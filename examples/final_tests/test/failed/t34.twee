FTW uses language like 'testicles' to refer to trans women's bodies -- see the original zine for Mira's explanation of why this is, there's a link to download it at the end of the story.

Muffing is the word that I use to describe the act of being fucked in one or both of my inguinal canals.

[[Back|1]]


:: FTW7 [ftw]
Muffing might sound painful, but it's not, or if it is painful, it's painful in a good way.

:: FTW5 [ftw]
Trans women who tuck often learn to push their testicles up and into the inguinal canals and to hold them there. Depending on how much and how often the inguinals are being used, they might initially be difficult to find, but with only a little practice they are actually quite easy to access.

:: About [about]
This is a short story about sex. In particular, it's about the sex act sometimes known as "muffing." The story contains images of genitals and detailed descriptions of fucking.

This might not be comfortable for everybody, especially people who have complicated relationships with their genitals. Take care of yourself.

:: FTW2 [ftw]
The inguinal canals are the twin 'pockets' that are situated in the groin above and behind the testicles and scrotum.

They are sealed from the outside but can still be penetrated, basically by turning the 'pocket' inside-out. (The technical term for this is "invagination.")

The outside-in scrotum then acts as a natural and flexible barrier and either one, or both, can be fucked.
