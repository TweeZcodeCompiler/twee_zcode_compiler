'A ship sets sail?' you hazard.

The bat king mulls this over for a moment. 'Hmmm,' he says at last. 'Well it didn't really make any sense, but it did rhyme, and of course that is the sign of an excellent poem. Very well, girls, my wings are yours, but I want them back when you're done with them.'

'Oh, really?' you say, surprised. 'But don't you need them?'

'No, they're just for decoration really. Clip ons.' He detaches them to illustrate his point. 'Lost mine in the war, but a chap doesn't feel complete without something flapping around back there. Anyway, enough of my ramblings. Many thanks for the poem, and good luck to you both.'

<<if $gotwingsonce>>You emerge from the cave to find Ethel waiting on the trail. Giant mechanical spiders are stomping about setting fire to things, and she is using superwater to rust their limbs. It's very loud and confusing.

'We got the wings again!' you whoop.

'What are you playing at?' asks Ethel. 'You've already got the wings! Get back in that cauldron and save the world already!'

'Ok, ok, relax,' you sigh before hopping into the Fast Travel Cauldron.

'Good work!' says Ethel. 'I'm running out of superwater, so you better get back in the Fast Travel Cauldron (patents pending). We need to kill that eye!'

You hand out samples of Bill's flour to the waiting customers, crying things like 'Free flour from the old crumbling windmill!' and 'Try before you buy!' to get their attention. Even super-cheap flour can't compete with free flour, and before long all the customers have gone home to try Bill's flour out, and the savvy business elf looks pretty annoyed.

'We've done a good thing here,' you say to Esme, who nods in agreement.<<set $doneFlour = true>>

Before too long you find yourself outside Ethel Frogbottle's rundown old cottage. Weeds threaten to devour the ramshackle structure, and the glass is broken in most of the windows. A faint, indeterminate odour pervades the still air.

<<if $gotRose>>'Um... Yes?' you say hesitantly.

The weird lady cocks her head to one side and a faraway look comes into her eyes. 'If someone finds me pretty, they'll bring me a flower. Do you ''have'' a flower for me?'

'Um, we've got this one,' you say, holding up the black rose the spider king gave you.

'It's beautiful,' whispers the swamp lady, and then she glides across the pool to collect it from your shaking hand. 'Somewhere in this pool is a treasure you seek. Fare well, travellers.' And with that she sinks back into the lake.

'Somewhere in this pool?' says Esme.

'That's what she said,' you nod. 'There's no way we're jumping in there.'

<<if $gotRod>>'The fishing rod!' exclaims your friend. 'We can fish for it!'

Congratulating Esme on her quick thinking, you cast your rod into the waters. Something tugs on the line, and you reel it in. It's...

A pair of spectacles?

Suddenly the wise old elf from the Place at the End of the End of Places appears in a puff of smoke, a nice effect which is almost lost against the backdrop of swamp smog. 'You found them!' he smiles. 'Where were they?'

'In there,' you say, pointing to the large pool.

'Ah,' says the wise old elf, wiping them on his robe. 'Yes, that's where they usually are. Anyway, shouldn't you be saving the world?'

'That's what we've been trying to do!' you protest. 'We need a wizard's tooth, remember?'

'Ah yes, well a deal's a deal. Here you are,' smiles the wise old elf, and reaching up he pulls out one of his own long, sharp teeth!

'Ew,' says Esme as he hands it to you.

''Quest Item Gained - Wizard's Tooth!''

'Couldn't you have just given us this straight away?' you ask, a little angrily.

'Well yes, but then I wouldn't have got my spectacles back,' says the wizard mildly. 'Anyway, you better get back to climbing this mountain! I was just kidding about the eye crossing, by the way.'

You angrily retrace your steps to the mouth of the tunnel where you encountered the leery fire sprite and continue your climb, cursing the wizard with every spare breath.

<<if $gotAmulet>>The amulet you got from the mysterious stranger begins to glow strongly. '//Now// you're showing me the proper path? The only way is up, you useless piece of junk.' With disgust, you yank the amulet from your neck and toss it from the mountain.<<endif>>

The eye is now positioned directly over the mountain. Waves of evil emanate from it, washing over the land. A series of increasingly horrible creatures make their way across the night sky towards Carn, ready to lay waste to everything you know. Although your arms and legs are tired, the climb becomes easier the higher you get, and when you look down Ebb and Sol are far below you. The eye is everything, and it's terrible stare transfixes you.

Now [[turn to 123|123]].<<else>>As you ''have'' no means of searching the pool, you are forced to leave the swamp. 'This is just getting annoying,' moans Esme.

'No, sorry,' you say, because you don't.

The lady sighs deeply. 'I see,' she says sadly. 'Fare well, travellers.' And with that she sinks back into the lake.

'I guess we better get her a stupid flower from somewhere,' says Esme as you trudge out of the swamp. 'Why is everyone so demanding around here?'

You blow sharply on the fire sprite, who slinks away to compose itself. Just like in the book! What's more he drops 10 Gold, which you quickly pocket. You also gain the experience of defeating a leery fire sprite.<<set $gotGold = true>>

''Item Gained - A Little Gold''

'Let's check out this tunnel!' you say excitedly. You walk along the tunnel, which is just as well-lit and nicely decorated as it appeared. Unfortunately all you find at the end is the fire sprite's living space, which holds only a book about how to attack ladies and few singed blankets. Finding nothing of interest, you double back and head down the dank, gloomy tunnel, your footsteps echoing all around you. Eventually there is a dim light up ahead, and as you draw closer it grows brighter.

<<set $ftcHill = true>>You emerge blinking into daylight - but that makes no sense, there's no way you've walked far enough to go right through the mountain. You stand at the top of a sloping hill, at the base of which is a great lake that opens into the sea. Besides a faint breeze playing across your earholes, all is silent. A pirate ship bobs lazily on the waters. On one side of the lake, flags flying above a small town can be made out. On the other you see what looks like an expanse of marshland. Oh, and the Fast Travel Cauldron is here, too.

'This place is weird,' says Esme, and you're inclined to agree.

'Hey, notice anything missing?' you say. 'I don't know where we are, but the eye hasn't got here yet. Let's hurry all the same.'

You head back to the bat guy cave entrance, where the pile of semi-conscious bat guys is struggling to seperate. 'Why you do dis fing?' wails one of them, and you almost feel sorry for the illiterate brute.

'This is useless,' you snarl. 'Fall back!'

You run from the room, knocking over a barrel in your haste. The powder spills towards the oil lamp, and then you realise it is gunpowder and therefore this is very bad! You leap up through the trapdoor, surprising the ghost, and leap from the deck as the ship explodes, propelling you forward to land on your faces at the waterside.

'That was awesome!' says Esme. 'My face hurts.'

<<if $prevlocfc>>'Let's go this way,' you suggest. Esme doesn't object, so you head down the winding path to the west.

'I choose death!' you shout enthusiastically.

The sprite seems slightly taken aback. 'Really? No-one ever said that before. Usually they just help out around the orchard. In fact, I've never actually killed anyone before.'

'Oblivia, what in blazes are you doing?' hisses Esme between splutters.

'Trust me, I've got a plan!' you hiss back.

The tree sprite teeters this way and that. 'Are you sure you don't want to help out around the orchard?'

'Nope,' you smile. 'It's death or nothing.'

'Curses!' cries the sprite. 'It's just not in me to take another life!' And with that, he disappears in a puff of moral dilemma.

'How did you know he wouldn't kill us?' asks Esme, finally recovering.

'Just a hunch,' you shrug, looking at your watch. 'Ooh, it's nearly dinnertime!'

As the words leave your lips, Esme's head thuds dejectedly to her desk, and your heart sinks.

'Not even close,' snarls Mistress Honeywell. 'This simply isn't good enough. If it happens again I shall see you in Madam Scrimshaw's office, and I hope you'll pay more attention there.'

'Sorry, miss,' you mutter. And you are, a bit.

Finally the lunch bell rings out from the courtyard, and you quickly make your escape.

Outside, a flushed and slightly out of breath Esme waits impatiently. 'Thank Gaia that's over,' she pouts. 'I thought I was going to die of boredom, literally //die.// So, what do you want to do?'

With Esme in tow you bury yourself in the forest, following notches carved into the tree trunks until you come to a clearing. A single tree grows in the centre, and finger-wide grooves in the bark help you climb up to a ramshackle structure clinging to the canopy like a scared wood-and-nails cat.

You and Esme spent weeks building this treehouse, though even your own rose-tinted perspective uses the term loosely. A woven rug protects bums from splinters, a shoebox contains snacks and drawing materials and an oil lamp provides sufficient light to draw by. In the corner is a modest pile of comic books that you have made in the six years since you became friends, and pinned to the wall-planks are dozens of pages of character designs for the latest project. Your art styles are similar, but you can easily identify Esme's work because she always dots her 'i's with a heart. Esme takes a pencil and some paper and begins to work on a sketch.

'Talk to me,' says the business elf as you approach.

'Um... Ok,' you reply, taken slightly off guard. 'How's it going?'

'Business is booming!' glows the elf. 'Up 300 percent from last week, in fact. Speculate, accumulate, repeat. You?'

'We're off to help out a witch,' you reply, wondering what on earth he's going on about.

'Witches love flour! Buy her a bag, it's cheap!'

<<if $gotGold>>You decide to hold on to the measly 10 Gold you got from the leery fire sprite to buy something more exciting than flour.<<else>>'We don't have any money,' you admit.<<endif>>

The smile melts from the business elf's face, and he goes all frowny. 'I have no time for you,' he says. 'Please leave at once.'

'How rude!' says Esme as you set off. 'I much prefer Bill's old rundown windmill, even if the flour is more expensive. Harrumph!'

'I am Oblivia Firespoon,' you announce in hushed reverence, 'and this is my good friend Esme Featherwhistle.'

The spider king nods a courteous greeting. 'Few venture this far into the stacks of the bookworld, and fewer still return to the land of men. For your bravery, child, a pretty flower.' With some of his legs he dramatically indicates a black rose lying on the floor nearby. You pick it up, thank him for his kindness and leave the library, making it look a little harder than it is so as not to hurt the spider king's feelings.

//You were lucky today, Spider King,// you think as you walk away. //Next time you'll get what's coming to you.//

''Item Gained - Black Rose!''<<set $gotRose = true>>

'What on earth was all that about?' asks a bemused Esme.

Only a few minutes of lunch remain, so you quickly snarfle some snowfish sandwiches (your favourite) while a shiny-eyed Esme recounts your spider-stomping adventure to some first-years.

The fisherperson, hidden from view by a long, shabby cloak, doesn't turn as you approach.

'Um, excuse me?' you venture, but there is no response.

You reach out to touch his or her shoulder, a feeling of dread building within you as you do. The sun falls behind the distant peaks of Ebb and Sol. Esme tugs warningly on your sleeve.

As soon as your fingers touch the coarse fibres, the cloak crumples and the rod clatters to the ground. The fisherperson is nowhere to be seen.

'Whaaa?' gasps Esme, her mouth lolling open in amazement.

'It's getting late,' you say, the words catching in your dry throat. 'We should be getting home for dinner.' Unsure why, you stoop and pick up the fishing rod before hastily leaving.

'Hey, I know!' you exclaim brightly. The tree sprite pricks up his pointy ears with interest. 'Why don't //you// eat an apple?'

'Me?' cries the tree sprite. 'Eat an apple? Hark at the child! Why, it'd be like eating my own children!'

'Aw, c'mon,' you goad, 'they're delicious! Just try a little bite.'

The tree sprite cocks his head to one side, considering this. 'Well, I suppose one little bite can't hurt.' He chews on a small green apple thoughtfully. 'Gadzooks, this //is// delicious!'

So you all sit and eat apples together while the sun goes down, and you soon become fast friends. Before long there is little you don't know about each other, and you're calling him Friend Tree Sprite.

You glance at your watch. 'Gosh, is that the time? We're going to miss dinner. Not that I feel that hungry after all these apples.'

'Run along, girls, but promise you'll come back and visit your friend. Oh, and if you happen to run into my brother, mention Treezlebub's name and he'll sing you a song, probably.'<<set $knowTreezlebub = true>>

You lower your foot. 'Better make this good,' you warn.

'Oh thank you, kind madam!' exclaims the evil looking bug with a deep bow, 'Truly, I am undeserving of such pity. You see, I was just a normal bug, heading to the orphanage with some delicious cookies, when a snooty vampire bit me! Now I'm an evil looking vampirey bug. I guess he must have taken the cookies too.'

'Well, I guess that kind of makes sense,' you say slowly.

'Anyway, to prove my good intent I'll help you out with the rest of the weeding, and so will a few of my friends!' He clicks and whistles, and suddenly there are weird bug things everywhere. They flit about like mad things, devouring most of the larger weeds while you pull up the smaller ones. Then they bid you good day and buzz off into the sunset.

'All finished, are we?' sniffs Ethel disapprovingly. 'Well, the garden does look a little tidier, I suppose. Tell you what, go and tidy up the attic for me and then you can run along home.'

You traipse up a rickety staircase to the dark, dusty attic, where flittery somethings scurry into cobwebbed corners to peer out at you. Glass tanks hold odd shapes that you'd rather not look at too closely, and spidery etchings adorn the walls. Esme shudders a lot.

'Hey, what's this?' you exclaim, picking up a book with a weird face on the front.

'Eep!' cries Esme. 'Put it down! Books with faces on can only have bad things inside!'

With effort you manage to shrug off your soporific state and make an earnest attempt to follow Mistress Honeywell's apparently endless lecture.

'The lesser spotted fuzzwort is known for the mysterious qualities it imbues upon one who consumes it, such as super strength and night vision.

'Follow my lead,' you hiss to Esme. You start to do your best impression of a bat-guy, making little whistly noises, flexing your arms and stomping about like an idiot. Esme does the same, though whether or not she realises what you're doing is unclear. The bat seems fooled however, for lets out a yelp, springs out of the bed and salutes as smartly as can be expected for a giant lumbering bat.

'Dur, sorry Batsy was sleeping in king bed,' says the giant bat. 'King out on business and Batsy not like hang upside down. Please no kill Batsy.'

As surprised by the effectiveness of your impression as you are by the revelation that this isn't the bat king, but simply an imposter named Batsy, you hesitate.

'Well, Batsy,' Esme says sternly, 'we won't kill you this time so long as you keep quiet and don't tell anyone you saw us here.'

'Ok, sure, Batsy keep real quiet!' shouts Batsy as you shush him frantically. 'Batsy keep real quiet,' he whispers, and grins when you give him the thumbs up. 'Bye then!' he waves, stomping loudly out of the room, but remembering to close the door behind him.

'I think the fuzzwort's wearing off,' you say. 'It's getting kinda dark, and I don't feel like I'm dying inside.'

'So what now?' asks Esme. 'Hide until the king comes back?'

'That won't be necessary,' says a tiny crowned bat who has apparently entered through a tiny hole in the door. 'I am the bat king. What is the meaning of all this?' The door opens, and two massive armoured bat guards appear behind him. A third squeezes between them and lifts the tiny bat king onto his enormous bed.

'We've come for your wings!' cries Esme bravely.

'Oh, really?' laughs the bat king, making himself comfortable. 'Tell me, girls, do you know any poetry? I'm rather fond of it. If not, my friends here can see you out.'

<<if $knowPoetry>>'Hey, we //do// know some poetry!' says Esme excitedly. 'We read it down at the lake, remember?'

'Oh yeah!' you nod. 'Now, how did it go... I think I remember! Ahem,

Your eyes start doing their thing, and you see that giant mechanical spiders are stomping about setting fire to things, and Ethel using superwater to rust their limbs. It's very loud and confusing.

'Hey, kids, did you get them bat wings?' says Ethel.

'Nah, we were gonna go and do something else,' you reply, dodging a flaming web.

'These spiders keep coming out of the void,' says Ethel. 'They run on empty promises, and their only emissions are broken dreams. I can't hold them off much longer, so you better hop in the Fast Travel Cauldron (patents pending) and head back. Remember, any stuff that you've found or learnt will be retained, so try stuff out.

You stand at the very peak of the third mountain of Carn. Only fifty feet above you the eye spreads like a virus, infecting suns, devouring stars, and watching, always watching.

The world below is lost to you. Any feeling, any emotion you might once have known has been stripped away from you like meat from a carcass, and now there is only this.

'Um, it's Oblivia and Esme. You don't know us. We're just, er, on a quest and that.'

<<if $gotCroissant>>'Will a croissant do?' you ask hopefully.

'Will it? //Will// it! Oh boy, oh boy. Gimme!' says the voice urgently. The door creaks open, and a hand pops out to grab the proffered pastry before slamming it again. The slightly gross sounds of desperate chewing follows. 'Oh, wow! This is great! Where did you get this?'

'The bat guy cave,' you reply.

You emerge from the cave to find Ethel waiting on the trail. Giant mechanical spiders are stomping about setting fire to things, and she using superwater to rust their limbs. It's very loud and confusing.

'Hey, kids, how goes it?' says Ethel.

'Okay, I guess,' you reply, dodging a flaming web.

'These spiders keep coming out of the void,' says Ethel. 'They run on empty promises, and their only emissions are broken dreams. I can't hold them off much longer, so you better hop in the Fast Travel Cauldron (patents pending) and head back. Remember, any stuff that you've found or learnt will be retained, so try stuff out.

You pull the door, realise it's a push door, then push it while feeling a little silly. This time it opens, and a grand cabin awaits you, with all the fancy items you'd associate with one. Globes, a big desk, some stuffed fish, the whole shebang. You don't have long to take it all in, because a zombie pirate king is lumbering towards you!

'Braiiiins?' asks the zombie pirate king. Unsure how to answer, you run back into the corridor. You push the other door, realise its a pull door, curse the inconsistency of this ship's design, then pull it while feeling rather frustrated. You find yourself in a store room cluttered with all manner of useless junk.

'This junk is useless!' complains Esme.

'What wizard? What are you talking about?' Esme whispers back.

'You know, we need a wizard's tooth to save the world, right?'

You and Esme look at each other doubtfully. 'Respectfully, sir,' you say, 'Carn only has two mountains.'

The old elf smiles benignly, then giggles malignantly. 'You have much to learn about the ways of the world, girls. Turn around, and cross your eyes.'

'Do what now?' is your initial response, but you do as he says.

'You must make the mountains meet, and become one,' says the elf. 'That is the secret of Carn.'

'Really?' says Esme. 'That's kinda dumb.'

'Are the mountains overlapped? Can you see the third mountain?' he says fervently. 'Can you see the great miracle?'

'Um... we can see the two mountains overlapped.'

'Wonderful!' claps the elf. 'Now go forth and climb the mountain! And keep your eyes crossed the whole way, or you will fall to your deaths.'

'Wow, ok,' you say. 'I guess we'd better get going.'

'Erm, I'm the egg inspector!' you say improvisationally. 'And, I've come to take this egg to the egg inspection... thing. So, I'll just be -'

'You are Oblivia Firespoon, and you have come to take my egg to save the world,' says the Moonbird quietly, staring deep into your eyes.

You want to look away, but you cannot. 'Sorry,' you whisper, and you truly mean it.

'Take it,' says the Moonbird sadly. 'But know this - I am the last of the Moonbirds, at the end of my life, and this is the only egg I'll ever lay. It can only hatch in a place of pure darkness, and this nest at night is the last such spot in Carn, so when it is removed my kind will die out. Now before you leave you will hear my song.'

<html><img src="018.jpg" width="413" height="550"></html>

And then the Moonbird begins to sing; a sweet, slow, mournful song that washes over your senses and puddles in your soul. Discordant harmonies creep in, dancing in and out of the melody like the ghosts of fallen warriors, and as you stand transfixed lights twinkle in each and every tree as the weird and wonderful inhabitants of the Wooded Realm peek between the leaves to watch. The song lasts forever, and then it is over, and the Moonbird lays down to sleep, and not to wake.

'What was all that squawking about?' asks Esme as you reach the base of the tree. 'Have you been crying?'

'Um, yeah, a bit,' you say feebly, 'but I'm alright now. And look, I've got the egg!'<<set $gotEgg = true>>

'You're probably right,' you say, reluctantly replacing the book. It seems to stick to your fingers, and even after you've put it down you feel a strong attraction to it. Slightly unnerved, you cross to the other end of the attic and busy yourself with a spot of cobweb dusting. You find a collection of pointy hats and start to clean them, brushing the tops and bottoms counter-clockwise with a soft brush, and hanging them from pegs to retain their shape.

'So it looks like she's definitely a witch, then,' you say to Esme. 'Cauldron, pointy hats, there's a few broomsticks over there. I'd say it's a sure thing. She seems very nice, though.'

Esme says nothing, which is unusual, but maybe she's just busy cleaning.

'Later on we could head down to the lake,' you continue. 'I could do with some peace and quiet after today.'

When Esme doesn't respond, you turn around, sensing that something is wrong. It is. Esme is reading the face-book! She is also hovering slightly above the ground, her eyes look all weird and she is silently mouthing something.

'Esme, what the prakk are you doing?' you gasp.

'Well, I've always been fond of animals,' says Esme hesitantly, 'so I'd like to walk the dog, I suppose.'

'Brilliant,' says Ethel. 'I'll go and get Bloodwart, then.'

Any hopes of Bloodwart being an ironically named ball of fluff are dashed when Ethel returns a moment later with a slavering heckhound that snaps wildly at you. Esme shrieks and hides behind a chair, so you get handed the leash.

'He's a big softy, really,' says Ethel affectionately, patting the great beast's head and quickly drawing her hand away when it attempts to bite it off. 'Well, off you go.' With that, she bundles all three of you out of the front door and shuts it firmly.

The excited heckhound shoots off toward the hills, dragging you along behind it while Esme struggles to keep up. You are pulled through a variety of hedges and ditches and even a low stone wall, but sustain only minor injuries.

The heckhound bursts into a forest glade where a terrified gnome family were enjoying a picnic. They drop their jam sandwiches in terror as the beast looks ready to devour them all.

You set off again up the interminable trail, putting one foot in front of the other, then putting the other foot down, down, down. 

Besides your own footsteps, a rustling in the undergrowth by the side of the trail is the first sound you've heard for a while, and it makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. A tree sprite emerges, notices you, and freezes.

'Are you... them?' he asks.

'Um... no?' you guess.

He relaxes a little. 'You're just a couple of kids,' he says, a little rudely for your liking. 'Listen, this place is - well, it's bad, and I'm not one for helping strangers. You should get out of here, quick-sharp.'

'No, Bloodwart!' you yell, launching yourself into a starberry trifle with extra starberries. 'Bad dog!'

Esme, in an unexpected fit of bravery, jumps onto Bloodwart's back, holding on to his collar for dear life as he snarls and bucks, trying to throw her off.

'Quick, go!' you gasp to the gnome family. 'We can't hold him much longer!'

The gnome family pause only to grab a few jam sandwiches before dashing into the trees. Eventually Bloodwart tires himself out and you're able to drag him back to the cottage.

'Back already, are we?' sniffs Ethel disapprovingly. 'Old Bloodwart looks worn out, bless him. Tell you what, go and tidy up the attic for me and then you can run along home.'

You traipse up a rickety staircase to the dark, dusty attic, where flittery somethings scurry into cobwebbed corners to peer out at you. Glass tanks hold odd shapes that you'd rather not look at too closely, and spidery etchings adorn the walls. Esme shudders a lot.

'Hey, what's this?' you exclaim, picking up a book with a weird face on the front.

'Eep!' cries Esme. 'Put it down! Books with faces on can only have bad things inside!'

You draw your fist back and smack the snake right in the mouth.

'What wassssss //that// for?' asks the snake, surprising you with it's talking.

'Erm,' you stutter, 'I thought you were going to... you know.'

The snake raises an eyebrow, which it has. 'Thought I wassssssss going to //what?//'

'Well,' you mumble, 'I thought you were going to mumble mumble.'

'Speak up, child!' roars the snake.

'I thought you were going to bite me!' you blurt, feeling rather embarrassed.

The snake draws itself up and manages to look indignant (the eyebrow helps). '//Bite// you!' it hisses, and then, shifting the emphasis, 'bite //you?//'

'I.. er... erm...' you stutter, ashamed by your prejudice.

'Oh wait a second, I //was// going to bite you!'

The snake lunges, and you punch it again, knocking it senseless! It falls from the tree, and you shout a warning to Esme below. She dodges the snake, which lands with a satisfying 'whump', kicks it under a bush and gives you two thumbs up.

You start to climb again, trying not to look down as you reach the dizzying heights of the canopy. Peering over the edge of the great nest, you see a tiny egg, kicking out an awful lot of mysterious glow for its diminutive size. This being a treasure you seek, you make straight for it, but your thieving hands are stilled by a great screech from above. You look up to see a gigantic golden bird peering at you with angry bead-eyes.

'Who are you,' squawks the bird, 'and what, pray, are you doing in my tree?'

'Um... We could help out a little, I guess,' you say noncommittally.

'Yay, helpers!' claps the tree sprite, jumping gaily into the air and clicking his heels. 'Did you hear that, everyone?' he shouts, 'they said they'll help!'

Suddenly all manner of woodland creatures appear; squirrels, owls and so on. Many of them hold gardening equipment in paw, claw or talon. They hand you both rakes and point their beaks, noses or snouts in the general direction of various fallen leaves, and you begin to sweep them up into neat piles as the sky grows dark.

'This is boring,' says Esme. 'We should have picked death.'

'Excuse me sir,' you say politely to the tree sprite, 'but we're going to be awfully late for dinner, so would you mind...?'

'Oh, are you still here?' asks the wood nymph. 'I forgot all about it, to be honest. On your way, then, quick quick.' And with that, he shoos you out of the orchard and off to dinner.

'I wouldn't riddle you ree if you were the last water devil in the bat guy cave!' you cry gleefully, punching his watery face which just sploshes about before reforming.

'Can't punch me, girly,' cackles the water devil, 'I'm //all// water! Now take this!' He launches some water magic at your hair, soaking it. 'That's gonna frizz so bad when it dries out!'

'Is that the best you've got?' quips Esme, getting into the swing of things.

'Hey, wait a second,' you say, engaging your think-parts, which don't seem to be working so well since you ate that root. 'If you're just water, what's to stop us just walking straight through you?'

'Because you'll get horribly wet,' laughs the water devil. 'A fate far worse than death!'

You exchange shrugs with Esme, then stride straight through the spluttering water devil and over to the creaky-looking door.

'A lucky escape, girls!' cackles the beaten water devil pathetically. 'You'd never have solved my super-hard riddle! And you'll take ages to dry out!'

'Shut up already!' you snap, opening the door, which surprisingly doesn't creak at all. 'We're not even that wet!'

You emerge into a large echoey space with an odd bat-patterned roof. Then you inwardly realise 'Hey, that's no pattern, but hundreds of bat guys hanging upside down!' Judging from all the batsnores, they seem to be asleep. You motion Esme to keep quiet while you scope out the room, which has a large ornate door labelled 'BAT KING ROOM' and a small cheap door labelled 'BAT GUY ROOM'.

From the corner of your eye you notice your best friend Esme's fiery red hair bobbing about, and you wonder idly what manner of mischief she might be causing.

The fast travel cauldron sits in a corner. It seems no-one but you and Esme can see it!

'Hmm... No?' you say hesitantly.

'I see,' says the scary lady. 'You possess an honest heart, child. A rare quality, but one that will win you no favours with me. Good luck in your quest.'

'Okay, thanks,' you say as she sinks below the waters, and then to Esme, 'I probably should have said yes, right?'

'We all make mistakes,' says your friend with an encouraging smile. 'Let's get out of here, anyway.' You carefully retrace your steps.

'Perpetual snail?' you hazard.

The bat king mulls this over for a moment. 'Hmmm,' he says at last. 'Well it didn't really make any sense, but it did rhyme, and of course that is the sign of an excellent poem. Very well, girls, my wings are yours, but I want them back when you're done with them.'

'Oh, really?' you say, surprised. 'But don't you need them?'

'No, they're just for decoration really. Clip ons.' He detaches them to illustrate his point. 'Lost mine in the war, but a chap doesn't feel complete without something flapping around back there. Anyway, enough of my ramblings. Many thanks for the poem, and good luck to you both.'

''Quest Item Gained - Bat King's Wings!''<<set $gotWings = true>>

<<if $gotwingsonce>>You emerge from the cave to find Ethel waiting on the trail. Giant mechanical spiders are stomping about setting fire to things, and she is using superwater to rust their limbs. It's very loud and confusing.

'We got the wings again!' you whoop.

'What are you playing at?' asks Ethel. 'You've already got the wings! Get back in that cauldron and save the world already!'

'Ok, ok, relax,' you sigh before hopping into the Fast Travel Cauldron.

'Good work!' says Ethel. 'I'm running out of superwater, so you better get back in the Fast Travel Cauldron (patents pending). We need to kill that eye!'

<<set $beenShip = true>>You traipse down the hill and paddle out to the pirate ship, which seems to be deserted.

'Give us a leg-up,' you say, and Esme only complains a little before kneeling in the water to give you a boost. You manage to grab a rope and climb onto the deck, then reach down to help Esme up. After a little kerfuffle you both stand aboard the ship.

'Let's check out the poop deck,' says Esme, and you both fall about giggling. You don't actually know your poop deck from your fo'c's'le, so you just try the first door you come to, which takes you into the sleeping quarters. A bunk bed appears to hold a unconscious figure, though their identity is concealed by way of a sheet. A trapdoor leads below.

You hop back through the doorway to find Ethel waiting on the trail. Horrible fire, water, earth and love monsters are everywhere, and she is using the opposing elemental magics to fend them off. It's very exciting and colourful.

'Hey, kids, how goes it?' says Ethel.

'Yeah, not bad,' you reply, ducking under a hate bolt which neatly dispatches a love phantasm.

'These monsters keep coming out of the void,' says Ethel. 'I'm running out of magic points, so you better hop in the Fast Travel Cauldron (patents pending) and head back. Remember, any stuff that you've found or learnt will be retained, so try stuff out. Go crazy! But the fabric of the universe can only hold out so long what with the huge purple eye and all this time travel, so let's try and get that stuff we need, okay?'

'Okay,' you nod, and hop into the Fast Travel Cauldron.

'You wouldn't be Treezlebub, by any chance?' you ask hopefully.

'How do you know my name?' the tree sprite asks sharply, his eyes narrow with suspicion.

'We bumped into your brother in the orchard,' explains Esme. 'He told us to look out for you.'

'Oh, really? Well, any friend of my brother's is a friend of mine! So tell me, what on earth are you doing out here?'

You explain your quest to save the world, which doesn't take long. Treezlebub listens keenly throughout, his head cocked to one side to emphasise his attentiveness. 'Ah, well I did wonder what that giant terrifying eye was doing up there. You mentioned the speckled egg of a moonbird, right? Well, this is your lucky day! It just so happens the fabled moonbird nests in the Moontree, deep in the Wooded Realm, and only I know how to get there. You have to run straight at that tree.'

He points at a tree. You look at Esme doubtfully. 'For realsies?' you ask the tree sprite.

'Yup,' he replies solemnly.

Expecting nothing but a sore head, you dash full force at the tree - but the impact never comes! Instead you find yourself in what looks like a vast underground cavern filled with dense forest. A moment later Esme appears through a magical floating doorway behind you, panting a little.

'Glad you made it,' you say.

'What is this place?' whispers Esme in awe. 'I mean, I know it's the Wooded Realm and all that, but it's... //odd//.'

You stand in a clearing, surrounded by tall, branchless trees. A path winds away to the west, and a stone bridge crosses a stream to the east. A crooked tree in the centre of the clearing look climbable, and could afford a good view of your surroundings.<<set $prevlocfc = true>><<set $investrustle = true>><<set $treeclimb = true>><<set $beenHut = false>>

'Ok, sure, whatever,' you say, trying to control a severe facial tic you seem to have developed. 'Just make it quick.'

'Oh, don't worry,' says the water devil. 'It's only - the Hardest Riddle Ever! Ahem:

My first is in water, wave and wet,
My second in albatross, aft and... er... well, anyway,
My third is in - um, let me think. Tiller, that's part of a ship right? Yeah, tiller, and -- tench, and... um.
My fourth -'

'Is it water?' you interrupt.

'Awww, man!' cries the water devil. 'How'd you guess?'

'Worst. Riddle. Ever,' says Esme flatly.

'Nooooo!' cries the water devil, exploding into refreshing globules.

'So there was that,' you say to Esme as you head through the creaky-looking door, which surprisingly doesn't creak a bit. You emerge into a large echoey space with an odd bat-patterned roof. Then you realise that's no pattern, but hundreds of bat guys hanging upside down! Judging from all the batsnores, they seem to be asleep. You motion Esme to keep quiet while you scope out the room, which has a large ornate door labelled 'KING ROOM' and a small cheap door labelled 'BAT GUY ROOM'.

'Well Bill,' you sympathise while edging away, 'that really sucks, but we've got a witch to visit, so... You know how it is.'

'Of course, of course,' says Bill waving you along. 'We've all got our problems, and I'll probably figure something out. Well, see you later girls!'

'I feel bad for him,' you say to Esme as you move on, 'but what can we do, really? We've already got to look after a witch all summer, I don't think we'd have time to help out around the old windmill too.'

'Feh,' shrugs Esme in agreement.

Before too long you find yourself outside Ethel Frogbottle's rundown old cottage. Weeds threaten to devour the ramshackle structure, and the glass is broken in most of the windows. A faint, indeterminate odour pervades the still air.

'I'm investigating that rustling,' you announce boldly, and Esme claps your bravery. After striking a heroic pose you venture into the undergrowth, where you find and squish a number of potentially undiscovered bug species. Sooner or later you come across a hollow tree stump, containing a giant ladybird drinking from a tiny china teaset.

'Oh, hello,' says the ladybird as you peer into the stump. 'Would you like some tea?'<<set $investrustle = false>>

<<set $ftcHill = true>>Keeping well away from the leery fire sprite, you head down the dank, gloomy tunnel, your footsteps echoing all around you. Eventually there is a dim light up ahead, and as you draw closer it grows brighter. You emerge blinking into daylight - but that makes no sense, there's no way you've walked far enough to go right through the mountain. You stand at the top of a sloping hill, at the base of which is a great lake that opens into the sea. Besides a faint breeze playing across your earholes, all is silent. A pirate ship bobs lazily on the waters. On one side of the lake, flags flying above a small town can be made out. On the other you see what looks like an expanse of marshland. Oh, and the Fast Travel Cauldron is here, too.

'This place is weird,' says Esme, and you're inclined to agree.

'Hey, notice anything missing?' you say. 'I don't know where we are, but the eye hasn't got here yet. Let's hurry all the same.'

You push the door, realise it's a pull door, then pull it while feeling a little silly. This time it opens, and you head into a store room cluttered with all manner of useless junk.

'This junk is useless!' complains Esme. 'We should have tried the other door.'

'We still can,' you point out. 'But hey, what's this?' You pull at something shiny under some other non-shiny stuff, and it turns out to be a super-cool piratey sword!

''Item gained - Piratey Sword!''<<set $gotSword = true>>

'Sweet!' says Esme. 'Now let's try that other door.'

You pull the other door, realise its a push door, curse the inconsistency of this ship's design, then push it while feeling rather frustrated. A grand cabin awaits you, with all the fancy items you'd associate with one. Globes, a big desk, some stuffed fish, the whole shebang. You don't have long to take it all in, because a zombie pirate king is lumbering towards you!

'Nah, I'm fine, thanks. I don't really like tea.'

The ladybird flaps indignantly. 'Well, really! I never heard of such a thing. No tea?' So wildly does she gesticulate that her tea is quite spilt, but she doesn't seem to notice.

'Yeah, no tea,' you shrug. 'Sorry?'

'Fuhgetaboutit,' says the ladybird. 'And to think I was going to give you a super cool grappling hook!'

'A what now?' you ask, curiosity piqued. You glance around and spot a super cool grappling hook leaning against a tree trunk. 'Oh, nifty,' you remark.

'Yep, and now you'll never know the untold joys of a hook on a rope,' smirks the ladybird.

'Yeah, about that,' you say slowly, edging towards the grappling hook. 'What's to stop me just, y'know, taking it?'

The ladybird bridles. 'Don't you dare, you little cur! //Guards!//'

''Item gained - Grappling hook!''<<set $gotGrapple = true>>

You quickly grapple with the grappling hook and peg it back to a surprised Esme, who  provides an attentive audience as you bring her up to date. Despite the ladybird's still audible squawkings there's no sign of any guards, so you may resume your adventure thusly:

If you take the north path, [[turn to 78|78]].
If you head back to the first clearing, [[turn to 92|92]].

You rush towards your friend ready to grab the book away from her, but an unseen force pushes you back, smashing you into a set of shelves holding various mysterious artefacts which crash to the floor around you. Esme, apparently unaware of your attempts to interfere, continues to read, and as she does the dust around her begins to lift from the ground and take on strange shapes, dancing about, collapsing in on themselves, adopting ever more complex forms. The whole room begins to shake.

Suddenly Esme straightens, her head snapping back, her mouth opening wide as an inhuman sound escapes her throat; a terrible, strangled wail that assaults your ears and threatens to drive you to insanity.

You are dimly aware of Ethel bursting in, and then the witch and your friend shouting magic stuff at each other while crazy lights dance around the room. The lights become brighter, and you are forced to shield your eyes, but between your fingers you see some terrifying things.

And then it all stops - the lights, the screaming and the floating Esme, who lands flat on her bum. You rush to her side at once.

'Esme, are you okay?'

Your heart pounds as she stares at you blankly for a moment, then leaps with hope as she blinks a few times.

'Is it lunch time yet?'

The voice is small and faint, but unmistakably Esme's. You hug your friend tightly, relief coursing over you.

'Ahem,' coughs Ethel deliberately, staring out of a dusty window. 'This is all very sweet, but we have a problem.'

With Esme in arm you scamper over to the window, where you are rather alarmed to see a huge gash splitting the sky open, with a gigantic, terrible lizard-type eye peering through it. 'That doesn't look good,' you remark limply.

'Yes, when your little red friend read the incantation, she opened a dimensional rift through which all the evil of the universe will soon pour. Now, I'm pretty sure there's a way to stop it, but I'm going to need your help.'

Sunlight streams between the twin peaks of Ebb and Sol, struggling through the classroom window to warm your knees while Mistress Honeywell's dulcet tones threaten to lull you to sleep.

You allow your gaze to wander out of the window to the fountain below, where a pair of water sprites frolic. An elderly caretaker shuffles up to shoo them away, and they dance around him, mocking his slow movements.

'Miss Firespoon, you seem distracted. Have you actually been listening today?'

:: The Eye


You clip the bat kings wings on to your back and take off, hurtling towards the eye. It begins to blink, to shield itself from you, but you are too fast for it. You remember the Moonbird's words - //only in a place of pure darkness//...

The wizard's tooth, clenched tightly in your fist, drives into the great black pupil, and the universe is filled with the greatest screech. Thick purple threads pour out of the hole, filling your mouth, choking you, blinding you, but undeterred you pull the tooth down, making a gash into which you force the Moonbird's egg.

Then you are falling back to earth, the eye still staring at you but now in surprise, in horror, in human terms it can comprehend only in it's final moments. And from the eye the last of the Moonbirds bursts, and the universe is filled with its song as swoops down to save you. Esme leaps from the mountain top and grabs on behind you, and then you are borne down from the dizzying heights of the wizard's mountain, down between Ebb and Sol and out over Carn, painted below you in all her glory. The spectres shriek and fade away, the eye closes forever and evil is gone from the land. Then the Moonbird sets you gently down at Ethel's house and you go inside for tea.

'My eyes really hurt!' complains Esme.

'Tell me about it,' you grumble. 'I've got the worst headache ever. I can't believe that actually worked.'

But it did, because you're climbing up a mountain that wasn't there before you crossed your eyes, and now it is, because your eyes are crossed and you're climbing up it.

You pull yourselves up onto a ledge and find an opening that leads into the presumably magical mountain, so you decide to have a nose about. Inside you bump into a hot blur of red and orange that probably is something, but you can't tell because your eyes don't seem to be working properly anymore.

'Well, you two look very silly,' says the blur. 'Your eyes are all squiffy.'

'We have to keep our eyes crossed,' you explain, 'or the mountain will vanish and we'll fall to our deaths.'

'Really?' says the blur. 'That seems unlikely. I mean, my eyes aren't crossed, and I'm not falling to my death.'

'I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!' cries Esme. 'I'm uncrossing my eyes!'

'Are you dead?' you ask, groping around blindly.

'I'm not sure yet,' groans your friend.

You uncross your eyes and sit very still for a few minutes while they slowly start working again. Rather than disappearing the tunnel solidifies around you, and you see a classic two-way fork up ahead. The blur resolves itself into a leery fire sprite!

The fire sprite starts to dance back and forth in the entrance to one of the tunnels, looking lecherous and showing off an inappropriately loud shirt.

'Sister Keronikus warned us about these! She said they'd go for our ankles,' whispers Esme.

No surprise there, then. The barkeep, a stocky mountain orc, is busy polishing glasses with a grimy rag. A distinct lack of customers doesn't seem to be bothering him.

'Hey,' you say. The orc grunts in reply. 'So,' you continue, 'how's business?'

'Business?' asks the orc, seeming surprised. 'Well, I had some pirates in a few weeks ago, but I heard they were attacked by ghosts and zombies. Since then, nothing really. Did you want anything to drink?'

'We're a bit short,' you admit.

'Not to worry, I'm not really in it for the money,' grins the barkeep. 'Have whatever you like, on the house.'

You descend into what would be blackness if it weren't for your awesome night vision ability, but instead is a dank chamber, with a splashy floor and moss-hugged walls that seem to bend a bit, but maybe that's just the root talking. Besides the steps, the only exit is a creaky-looking door in the far wall.

'This place is a dump,' grumbles Esme. 'And, I can't feel my knees so much.'

A water devil slips from a dark corner and slimes over to you, grinning wetly.

'Welcome to my humble abode!' he says creepily, spreading his arms and splashing you a bit. 'If you wish to pass through this room, you first must riddle me ree!'

Ethel makes a pot of tea, and you all sip from little china cups.

'Well,' she begins, 'in order to save the world completely, we need three magic type things; the wings of a giant bat, a tooth from a real live wizard, and the speckled egg of a moonbird, which may or may not exist. Any one of the three will slow them down, but all three would be preferable if we don't want to wind up dead.'

'That would be nice,' you comment, and Esme agrees fervently.

'Luckily for you you have a witch, and therefore time, on your side. Behold my latest bewitchment, the Fast Travel Cauldron (patents pending), which will appear at certain points throughout your journey and enable you to travel not only through space, but also time!'

'Oooh,' says Esme, who's into that kind of thing.

'So any time you need it, just hop in and say where, and/or when, you want to go. Because it's all magic, you will retain any objects and knowledge you may have gained beforehand, enabling you to try different paths through your day to help you overcome the challenges. You can't go back too far though, it still needs a little work.'

'Sounds complicated,' you say doubtfully, half-wondering whether this has all been an elaborate ruse to get you into a cauldron, and ultimately Ethel's belly.

'I'm kind of bad at explaining stuff,' admits Ethel, 'but you'll get the hang of it. Now, to retrieve the treasures you must travel to the End of Places, between the peaks of Ebb and Sol. I can magic you there, to save you the walk. You will face three challenges, each of which will hopefully lead you to one magic thing that we need. When you get stuck, you'll need to hop in the cauldron, travel back in time and try doing something else with your day. I'll catch up with you later. Any questions? No? Good. Then KAPOW!'

Ethel waves her witchy hands, and you feel yourself hurtling through space...

'Good work, Esme!' you smile, ruffling your friend's shock of red hair while she complains and bats you away. 'Let's get going.'

Despite the treacherous conditions you make steady progress. The 'X' on the map turns out to be a particularly large pool, and draw to a halt as a figure slowly rises from it's centre. It is a grey-skinned lady with straggly black hair in a long white dress. Even if she hadn't just risen out of a misty swamp pool, she'd still look pretty creepy.

'Greetings, travellers,' she says mournfully. 'It's a long time since anyone's come to see me. All the young men from the village used to visit, but one by one they stopped. They said I was beautiful, but that was a long time ago.' She fixes you with her large, pale eyes. 'Do you think I'm... beautiful?'

You ''have'' no idea which way to go. 'We could get easily get lost out here,' you say. 'We'd better head back.' Esme eagerly agrees, and together you make your way back out of the swamp.

You spread your arms, screech like a banshee and launch yourself from the canopy, landing squarely in a prized cucumber patch and destroying many of the prouder specimens. Luckily the grower is nowhere to be seen.

'Are you alright?' asks Esme from the safety of the tree.

'Fine,' you shout, fighting your way through mixed shrubbery to get back to the clearing. Esme descends in a more traditional manner and you regroup.

'I've got an idea,' you say to Esme. 'Follow me!'

You shimmy up a column and find a free spot to hang from. Good ol' Esme does the same. Luckily the other bats awake before the fuzzwort wears off, and seeing you hanging upside down they accept you as one of their own. Over the next few weeks you become firm friends with the bat guys, though they laugh at your puny muscles, and before too long you almost forget the world you left behind. Eventually you know the surprisingly linear cave network so well that you don't even need the fuzzwort to see anymore.

One day you are polishing some bat armour when someone hisses at you from behind a naturally formed rock pillar. As everyone knows bats don't hiss, so you approach with caution. Reaching out you feel a long nose and a pointy hat, and suddenly you remember Ethel.

'What happened to you, kiddo?' she asks. 'You were supposed to be saving the world, remember?'

'Oh, yeah!' you say, remembering. 'What happened with that?'

'Well, the world ended,' says Ethel, 'and it took quite a while for me to get back, through magic. Anyway, I'm here now, so I'm just going to magic you back to before you became bat guys, or whatever you're supposed to be, and maybe you can do something more pragmatic.'

'Ok, sure. Gah!' you say.

Ethel waggles her fingers, and you find yourself transported back in time...

'So what should we do?' says Esme.

<<if $goteggonce>>You hop back through the doorway to find Ethel waiting on the trail. Horrible fire, water, dirt and love monsters are everywhere, and she is using the opposing elemental magics to fend them off. It's very exciting and colourful.

'We got the egg again!' you whoop.

'What are you playing at?' asks Ethel. 'You've already got the egg! You crazy kids. Get back in that cauldron and save the world already!'

'Ok, ok, chill,' you sigh before hopping into the Fast Travel Cauldron.

Bloodwart snarls furiously, his slavering fangs dripping beast-stuff all over the gnomes' picnic. Petrified with fear, the little guys stare wide-eyed into the blood red beads of the heckhound fated to eat them all up.

As you watch in mock horror, Bloodwart pounces - and begins furiously licking the gnomes as they giggle uproariously.

'It tickles!' cries the mummy gnome as a particularly vigorous slurp dislodges her hat.

After a few minutes, Bloodwart grows tired and settles down for a nap.

'Sorry about your picnic,' says Esme.

'Oh, that's alright,' says the daddy gnome. 'We don't like jam sandwiches that much anyway, we only made them because we ran out of marmalade. Besides, this turned out to be the best day ever! Come on campers, let's sing!'

The gnome family launch into a happy song about how much they love each other and what a great day it was. Feeling slightly ill, you grab Bloodwart's collar and drag the slumbering beast away from the proceedings and back to the cottage.

'Back already, are we?' sniffs Ethel disapprovingly. 'Old Bloodwart looks worn out, bless him. Tell you what, go and tidy up the attic for me and then you can run along home.'

You traipse up a rickety staircase to the dark, dusty attic, where flittery somethings scurry into cobwebbed corners to peer out at you. Glass tanks hold odd shapes that you'd rather not look at too closely, and spidery etchings adorn the walls. Esme shudders a lot.

'Hey, what's this?' you exclaim, picking up a book with a weird face on the front.

'Eep!' cries Esme. 'Put it down! Books with faces on can only have bad things inside!'

You slip between the pages of reality, the universe rearranges itself around you, and then...

You find yourself standing with Esme at the entrance to the End of Places, Ebb and Sol towering high above you. Danger signs litter the area, and a deathly quiet pervades. The bleached bones of various creatures litter the area to serve as a warning to anyone silly enough to enter. Overhead the great eye watches through the hole in the sky. Esme gulps loudly in a cartoonish manner.

'So this is it, then,' you say. 'Time to save the world, I guess.'

'Is there anything we can do to help?' you ask, brimming with genuine concern.

'Well, I did have one idea... But no, it's ridiculous.'

'Everything's ridiculous!' snaps Esme, startling you both. 'Out with it, man!'

'Oh, my,' says Bill. 'Well, if it's not too much trouble you could take this bag of flour with you, and if you happen to pass the new windmill on your travels, you could hand some out to their customers? Maybe if they bake cakes with my flour, they'll come back to me.'

'Yeah, okay, sure,' you say, 'but enough with the flour already. We've got a witch to be visiting!'

'See ya, Bill!' chimes Esme, waving as you hurry on your way.

''Item gained - Bag of flour''<<set $gotFlour = true>>

Before too long you find yourself outside Ethel Frogbottle's rundown old cottage. Weeds threaten to devour the ramshackle structure, and the glass is broken in most of the windows. A faint, indeterminate odour pervades the still air.

At first the scratches seem to have been made purely at random, but then you realise they form barely readable words.

'Poetry is lame,' says Esme disgustedly. 'Do you think that fisherperson wrote it?' She points to the water's edge - but the mysterious fisherperson has disappeared.<<set $knowPoetry = true>>

'Oh, I suppose we could wash some pots,' sighs Esme resignedly, though she soon regrets her choice. It turns out Ethel's pot collection extends far beyond the piles in the living space; there are cupboards and pantries crammed full of them.

'How can one person need so many pots?' you cry in exasperation. 'It's just not normal!'

'Yes, and why are //all// of them dirty?' adds Esme.

You sing to each other to pass the long hours, and you scrub and scrub and scrub, and eventually the pots are as clean as they're going to get without your arms falling off.

'Oh wait, there's one more,' says Esme, reaching into the dark corner of a dingy pantry and retrieving a strange-looking pot with a handle at one end and a spout at the other.

'I'm not sure this technically qualifies as a pot,' you frown, 'but sure, whatevs.'

But as soon as you rub a dishcloth over the dusty surface purple smoke explodes from the spout, propelling the handle-spout-pot across the room and giving you quite a shock. The purple smoke disperses to reveal a grumpy yawning djinn.

<html><img src="006.jpg" width="400" height="300"></html>

'Who dares disturb my slumber?' grumbles the djinn sleepily, then waves off your response before it leaves your lips. 'I meant that rhetorically. Make a wish, it'll come true. Quickly, now, before I doze off.'

Ooh, a wish!

Feeling rather shy, you tiptoe around the house to peer through a window. Esme trips over a flowerpot and causes a small commotion, and there is a clattering from inside the house. You decide to run away, but before you can the front door opens suddenly, and a voice shouts 'Oi!', stopping you in your tracks. Esme fearlessly jumps behind a bush.

<html><img src="008.jpg" width="450" height="352"></html>

Ethel Frogbottle eyes you stonily. 'Whaddya want?' she half-growls.

'Um, we're here from the school? Y'know, to help out and stuff?' Your voice sounds small and scared.

Ethel looks around. 'Just you?' she says suspiciously.

'No, my friend Esme's here too.'

Esme waves from behind the bush.

'Right, well I suppose you'd better come in then.' She opens the door wide.

A large cauldron dominates the floorspace, and various pots and pans are arranged in piles around it. Books are stacked on threadbare furniture and along every available inch of wall space. A fire billows heat into the cluttered room, making you feel as though you're already being cooked.

'Sorry for the frosty reception,' says Ethel, making a forlorn attempt at a toothy grin. 'Thought you were the local kids, coming to accuse me of witchcraft and whatnot.'

'Ha ha,' you laugh nervously, adding a 'Ha!' for effect.

'What's so funny?' snaps Ethel.

'Oh nothing,' you backtrack, 'just, you know, witches. Everyone knows there's no such thing anymore.'

Ethel raises an eyebrow sharply. 'Oh, //isn't// there?'

There is an awkward silence.

'Well, anyway,' says Ethel, 'you're here to help, not sit around all day talking. I've got weeds need weeding, a big pile of dirty pots to wash, and a dog to walk. Take your pick.'

You decide to let Esme choose for a change.

Bill, the friendly orc who owns the crumbling old windmill, comes out to greet you as you approach. This guy's alway been there to offer a kind word when one of you has had a difficult time. Today he looks uncharacteristically tired.

'Esme! Oblivia! It's good to see you both,' he smiles.

'Hullo, Bill,' you grin. 'How's tricks?'

Bill lets out a great sigh. 'Not so good, truth be told.' Seeing your worried faces, he adds, 'I'm not dying or anything, it's just that business hasn't been so great lately. That swanky new windmill over the hill is stealing all my customers!'

You make the mistake of asking why, and Bill launches into a lengthy explanation. It turns out that he has a post mill, so called because it is balanced on a large upright post, allowing the mill to rotate to face the wind direction, wheras the swanky new mill is a tower mill, which means only the mill's cap needs to be turned into the wind. Long story short, the tower mill is taller, so the sails are longer, so when the wind is low they're still useful. Esme nods off a few times during the lecture, and you nudge her in the ribs.

'So you see,' finishes Bill, 'they've got me scuppered. No-one's come to buy my flour for weeks. But there's one flaw in their business model. They're leaving out the secret ingredient!'

'More flour?' hazards Esme.

'Nope. It's love!' beams the orc. 'That's why my flour makes the fluffiest cakes!'

You're not sure what to say, so you just nod enthusiastically. Then your neck starts to hurt, so you decide to say something.

You hurry along to your last class of the day, which unfortunately for you is Social Studies with Madam Crabsticks (known colloquially as Ol' Crabby due to her short temper and pincer-like grip). On the bright side, this is one of the few classes where you haven't been banned from sitting next to Esme, so she can poke you if you start to nod off.

After fifty minutes of tiresome waffle, Madam Crabsticks finally reaches the meat of the class.

'The more attentive among you will be aware that you are each to be given a special assignment for the holiday.' A chorus of groans indicate the general dissatisfaction of the assembled students. 'More specifically, you will pair up, choose an elderly person in the valley, and visit them each day to talk with them and assist them in any way you can. As you will be representing the school, we expect exemplary conduct from each and every one of you.'

With a flourish she produces a list of elderly people and passes it round the class, with each pair writing their names next to one. Since you and Esme are sitting at the back it gets to you last, and only one 'choice' remains. You blink, rub your eyes, then look at the last remaining name again.

'Ethel Frogbottle?' wails Esme. 'But she... she's a witch!'

'Don't be ridiculous, child,' scolds Madam Crabsticks. 'You are well aware that there are no more witches in Carn. It is precisely such scurrilous rumours that tarnish the reputation of the young.'

'But it's true, Ma'am," pipes up an alarmingly small girl who might be called Florence. 'She's got a big pot, an' everything!'

'She turned Daisy's cat into a dog,' murmurs Sophie Bramblethimble, but no-one seems to notice.

'Enough!' cries Madam Crabsticks, banging a bony hand on a desk for silence as the bell rings. 'You will each visit your charges first thing in the morning, and I shall expect glowing reports from each and every one. Dismissed.'

'Well, so much for the hols,' grumbles Esme as you leave through the gates of Clara Bumbleshoot's School for Wayward Orphan Girls. 'Now we've got six weeks of trying not to get eaten, or turned into something slimy.'

'Cheer up, Es,' you say, though your voice sounds a little hollow. 'It'll be an adventure!' Truth be told, you're pretty scared of witches.

'Well, we might as well enjoy our last night of freedom,' sighs Esme. 'What shall we do?'

You tiptoe over to the large ornate door, cringing with each click of shoe on stone as you try not to wake the slumbering bat guys. Reaching the door you slowly push it open. Esme slips in behind you and closes the door.

You find yourself in a huge royal bedroom, the centrepiece of which is an enormous silk-sheeted four poster bed. Stretched across the bed is the biggest, meanest looking bat you have ever had the displeasure to come across. It, like the guards, appears to be fast asleep. A sign at the foot of the bed says 'BAT KING'. These bat guys are helpful with the signs. 

'How on Carn are we gonna get his wings?' hisses Esme. 'They're the size of houses! Also, why is my arm turning blue?'

Suddenly the giant bat opens one eye and peers curiously at you. What a to-do!

'This is no problem for me,' you chortle inwardly, 'I'll simply charm the snake using my mad snake-charming skills.' It is only after making this decision that you remember you don't actually have any such skills. The snake seems to realise this too, and hisses at you all poisony.

You read a comic once where the snake-charming heroine was faced with a similar dilemma, and you try and cast your mind back to remember the details. Yeah, that was it! Raising your arms, you waggle your fingers while bobbing your head about. The snake seems distracted. You start to whistle a discordant melody. The snake looks confused. Finally, you hiss and lunge at the snake, which loses its balance and falls from the branch!

'Look out, Esme!' you cry, but looking down you see Esme must have read the comic too for she is charming the snake all over again.

You start to climb again, trying not to look down as you reach the dizzying heights of the canopy. Peering over the edge of the great nest, you see a tiny egg, kicking out an awful lot of mysterious glow for its diminutive size. This being a treasure you seek, you make straight for it, but your thieving hands are stilled by a great screech from above. You look up to see a gigantic golden bird peering at you with angry bead-eyes.

'Who are you,' squawks the bird, 'and what, pray, are you doing in my tree?'

You feel yourself slip between the pages of reality, the universe rearranges itself around you, and then...

Finally the lunch bell rings out from the courtyard, and you quickly make your escape.

Outside, a flushed and slightly out of breath Esme waits impatiently. 'Thank Gaia that's over,' she pouts. 'I thought I was going to die of boredom, literally //die.// So, what do you want to do?'

You stride up to the front door and rap sharply upon it while Esme bravely hides behind a bush. After a few moments there are cluttering noises from within, and then the door slowly creaks open.

'Oh,' you blurt, 'I wish I could see through walls!'

'Shazam!' cries the Djinn. But nothing seems to change.

'It's not working!' you say. 'I can't see through the walls!'

'Ah,' says the Djinn, waving a finger at you in a most frustrating manner, 'but you didn't specify which walls you wanted to be able to see through. In this case, it is up to me to decide, and I have decided that you can only see through walls which are already see-through, like glass ones.'

'Whaaaa?' you say. 'That's stupid. Are you sure you're a real Djinn?'

The Djinn produces the proper paperwork to show that he is indeed a registered Djinn. 'We're tricky like that,' he shrugs. 'In future, be careful what you wish for!'

'What a crock!' mutters Esme as the Djinn smokes back into the spout-handle-pot. You try rubbing it again, but nothing happens.

'All finished, are we?' sniffs Ethel disapprovingly. 'Well, the pots do look fairly clean, I suppose. Tell you what, go and tidy up the attic for me and then you can run along home.'

You traipse up a rickety staircase to the dark, dusty attic, where flittery somethings scurry into cobwebbed corners to peer out at you. Glass tanks hold odd shapes that you'd rather not look at too closely, and spidery etchings adorn the walls. Esme shudders a lot.

You traipse up a lengthsome trail, Esme complaining all the way. She falls quiet as the trail broadens, petering out at the base of a tree like no other you have ever seen, on account of how extremely big it is. A golden glow emanates from a nestlike formation in its distant canopy, and this, you are sure, must be the fabled Moonbird's egg.

'That must be the fabled Moonbird's egg!' you announce.

'So?' shrugs Esme.

'Well, y'know, that's one of the things we need to save the world!' you say, flapping your arms a little for effect.

'Oh yeah!' beams Esme. You wonder about that girl sometimes.

With nothing better to do, you begin to climb the Moontree, jamming your fingers into the deep grooves in the ancient trunk to pull yourself up. Esme, who has an irrational fear of oversized foliage, stays on the ground.

Halfway up you stop to rest on a great branch. Looking down you can just make out Esme, who waves up at you. Looking away you see a nasty-looking snake, poised and ready to strike, all tongue-flickery-like.

'An excellent choice!' beams the hobgoblin in congratulatory tones. 'This power is especially effective against earth-based stuff. That'll be 1,500 gold, please.'

'Oh, okay. Well, the only budget power I currently offer is zombie power. Just how much gold //do// you have?'

Without hesitation you stomp right on the bug. 'He was up to no good,' you say.

Esme nods solemnly, then does a double take. 'Hey, more bugs!' 

Suddenly there are weird little bugs everywhere, and you both set about squishing the lot of them, which takes quite a while and involves a lot of manic laughing. Afterwards you weed the remaining weeds and Ethel fetches you a mop to clean up all the gross bug guts.

'All finished, are we?' sniffs Ethel disapprovingly. 'Well, the garden does look a little tidier, I suppose. Tell you what, go and tidy up the attic for me and then you can run along home.'

You traipse up a rickety staircase to the dark, dusty attic, where flittery somethings scurry into cobwebbed corners to peer out at you. Glass tanks hold odd shapes that you'd rather not look at too closely, and spidery etchings adorn the walls. Esme shudders a lot.

'Hey, what's this?' you exclaim, picking up a book with a weird face on the front.

'Eep!' cries Esme. 'Put it down! Books with faces on can only have bad things inside!'

'An excellent choice!' beams the hobgoblin in congratulatory tones. 'This power is especially effective against ice-based stuff. That'll be 800 gold, please.'

'800 gold?' you gasp. We don't have that kind of money!'

'Oh, okay. Well, the only budget power I currently offer is zombie power. Just how much gold //do// you have?'

<<if $gotGold>>'We ''have'' 10 gold!' you beam proudly.

'What a coincidence!' says the shopkeeper. '10 measly gold is exactly how much zombie power is currently on sale for. Hand that blade over.'

You pay the man and give him your sword. He rubs it with a purple cloth and hands it back.

'I wish,' you say, carefully picking your words, 'that I could fly, while remaining in full control of my movement, and without causing any kind of harm to myself or others, and be able to stop flying when I choose to, and not be stopped from flying when I don't want to be, and for it not to be scary.'

'What an extremely well worded wish!' said the Djinn. 'You must have been really careful.'

'Yup!' you beam proudly.

'Hmmm... Well, I was hoping to trick you, but you seem to have left no loopholes. Very well, I shall give you the power of flight - but you may only use it once!' He waves his hands.

'The power of flight?' gawps Esme. 'For realsies?'

'Do as I do,' you hiss to Esme. You start moaning and wailing in your best impression of a ghost. Esme is quick on the uptake and starts to do the same, even grabbing some spare bedsheets to drape over you.

'What going on? Batsy confused,' says the large bat, who does indeed seem rather confused.

'We are ghosts,' you explain in what you suppose to be a ghostly wail, 'and we have come to haunt you, bat king.'

The giant bat waves his wings in protest, knocking various ornaments off a bedside table. 'Me no bat king! Me Batsy! No haunt Batsy!'

'Wait - you're not the bat king? Then what are you doing here?'

'Batsy was sleeping in king bed,' says the giant bat. 'King out on business and Batsy not like hang upside down. Please no haunt Batsy.'

'Well, Batsy,' Esme says sternly, 'we won't haunt you so long as you keep quiet and don't tell anyone you saw us here.'

'Ok, sure, Batsy keep real quiet!' shouts Batsy as you shush him frantically. 'Batsy keep real quiet,' he whispers, and grins when you give him the thumbs up. 'Bye then!' he waves, stomping loudly out of the room, but remembering to close the door behind him.

'I think the fuzzwort's wearing off,' you say. 'It's getting kinda dark, and I don't feel like I'm dying inside.'

'So what now?' asks Esme. 'Hide until the king comes back?'

'That won't be necessary,' says a tiny crowned bat who has apparently entered through a tiny hole in the door. 'I am the bat king. What is the meaning of all this?' The door opens, and two massive armoured bat guards appear behind him. A third squeezes between them and lifts the tiny bat king onto his enormous bed.

'We've come for your wings!' cries Esme bravely.

'Oh, really?' laughs the bat king, making himself comfortable. 'Tell me, girls, do you know any poetry? I'm rather fond of it. If not, my friends here can see you out.'

<<if $knowPoetry>>'Hey, we //do// know some poetry!' says Esme excitedly. 'We read it down at the lake, remember?'

'Oh yeah!' you nod. 'Now, how did it go... I think I remember! Ahem,

	In the end
	Words Fail
	Fallen Moons... Um...'

'Yes?' says the bat king, leaning forward and nearly falling off his cushion. The guards look ready to throw you out. What was that last line?

<<else>>Unfortunately you don't know any poetry, and with your super-strength waning the guards have little trouble ejecting you from the bat guy cave to sit blinking in the sunlight. They wedge themselves into the cave entrance, blocking any attempt at re-entry.

Your eyes start doing their thing, and you see that giant mechanical spiders are stomping about setting fire to things, and Ethel using superwater to rust their limbs. It's very loud and confusing.

'Hey, kids, did you get them bat wings?' says Ethel.

'Nah, we were gonna go and do something else,' you reply, dodging a flaming web.

'These spiders keep coming out of the void,' says Ethel. 'They run on empty promises, and their only emissions are broken dreams. I can't hold them off much longer, so you better hop in the Fast Travel Cauldron (patents pending) and head back. Remember, any stuff that you've found or learnt will be retained, so try stuff out. Go crazy! But the fabric of the universe can only hold out so long what with the huge purple eye and all this time travel, so let's try and get that stuff we need sharpish, okay?'

'I would very much like some tea, thank you,' you say in your politest voice, and you even summon up a curtsey from somewhere.

'Very good, very good,' mumbles the ladybird, handing you a cup. You carefully balance it on your little finger and sip at the liquid inside, which is cold and tastes suspiciously like tree sap (you know what tree sap tastes like, because you ate some once).

'Mmm,' you say, rubbing your belly as if you have just drank delicious hot tea, yet unsure why you continue your pretence of guestliness.

'I must say,' says the ladybird grandly, 'out of all the little girls to have wandered out of the undergrowth to join me for tea, you are certainly the politest. As a reward, take that grappling hook.' She motions to a tree with her wigglers, and you see the device resting against the trunk.

'Nice one!' you say gratefully, attaching the gadget to your belt.

''Item gained - Grappling hook!''<<set $gotGrapple = true>>

You both chomp eagerly on the fuzzwort, looking forward to super-strength and night vision and completely forgetting the horrendous side effects Mistress Honeywell warned you about. It tastes kinda funky, but suddenly you're able to see into the cave! Then you start to feel really dizzy, so you decide that's probably enough fuzzwort.

'Dur, where d'ya think you're going?' asks the muscliest of the bat guys as you stride boldly in.

You square up to him the best you can. 'Listen, mister,' you snarl, 'I've got a gutful of Fuzzwort and a heck of a headache, so you might not want to mess with me right now.'

'My eyes feel cold,' says Esme quietly.

<html><img src="020.jpg" width="500" height="208"></html>

'Come on, bat guys,' shouts the super-muscly bat guy while swimming in and out of focus, 'let's murderise 'em!'

You both get to punching, and soon the whole gang of bat guys is lying in a big pile of bruised bat-muscle. 'We hate you!' they scream as you skip deeper into the caves. You come to a junction. Rough steps carved from the stone lead down, and a tunnel leads northeast. It's a good job you brought your compass to school, or you wouldn't have known that.

'What are we doing here?' asks Esme curiously.

'We need the bat king's wings, remember?'

'Oh yeah, so we do!' Esme blinks a lot.

'The rain and hail?' you hazard.

The bat king mulls this over for a moment. 'Hmmm,' he says at last. 'Well it didn't really make any sense, but it did rhyme, and of course that is the sign of an excellent poem. Very well, girls, my wings are yours, but I want them back when you're done with them.'

'Oh, really?' you say, surprised. 'But don't you need them?'

'No, they're just for decoration really. Clip ons.' He detaches them to illustrate his point. 'Lost mine in the war, but a chap doesn't feel complete without something flapping around back there. Anyway, enough of my ramblings. Many thanks for the poem, and good luck to you both.'

'Oooh!' gasps Esme.

'Aaahh!' sighs Esme.

'That's about it for now,' says the shop keeper, but check back soon for more incredible illusions!' He holds the door open, and waits for you to leave.

You approach the mysterious figure, who holds out a hand in warning. 'Come no closer,' he/she/it intones in a rasping, whispery shout, 'for all who touch me will befall a mysterious and terrible fate.'

'Um... okay,' you say.

'Great adventures await you both,' continues the figure, 'but you will face many dangers along the way. This amulet will illuminate the proper path, but choose wisely when to use it.'

With these words, the hooded figure produces a clear plastic wallet containing a gaudy charm, and hold it out to you. 'Remember, don't touch me!'

You gingerly reach out and take the wallet, thanking the mysterious stranger.

'That's okay,' replies the stranger, 'but can I have the wallet back, please? I can use it again.'

You shift your attention (or lack thereof) to Esme, who appears to be inserting various items of stationery into the hair of Lydia Dragonbottom, a small girl unfortunate enough to both have a perm and be sitting directly in front of your wayward chum. So far she's managed four pencils, two rulers, a handful of paperclips and a protractor, but Lydia doesn't seem to have noticed.

Finally the lunch bell rings out from the courtyard, and you quickly make your escape.

'Erm, weeds, I suppose,' says Esme reluctantly. Ethel finds you gardening gloves and bee-keepers bonnets and you head out to the back yard. Bright sunshine beats down as you get straight to weeding, grabbing hold of their ugly heads and ripping them up at the roots like you're supposed to.

Suddenly Esme lets out a piercing scream, and you rush to her side. A weird evil-looking bug thing stares up at you 'twixt the grass-blades.

<html><img src="007.jpg" width="400" height="300"></html>

'Hullo, ladies,' says the bug courteously. 'Having a nice day, are we?'

'Don't look straight at it,' you hiss to Esme, 'it looks all evil!'

'Please don't be alarmed, my dears. I may look all evil, but I assure you I have a heart of gold. In fact, I was just on my way to the orphanage with these freshly baked cookies for all the delicious orphans. If one of you girls could furnish a chap with a few drops of human blood, I'd be very much obliged.'

'Oh, cool. Wait, //what?//' asks Esme.

You hop over the low wall of the local apple orchard and get to scrumping! Big, sweet red ones, small tart green ones, they all taste great to you. Before long you are sticky-chinned and overstuffed, and Esme keeps belching in a most unladylike fashion, causing you to burst into giggles.

'Most people would tell you to slow down or just start at the beginning, but as it happens I am a witch and therefore I can use my magic powers to understand whatever you're babbling about.' She waggles her hands in a magical fashion, then pales. 'Well, that's not good,' she says, shoving you out of the way and barging up the stairs.

Hot on her pointy witch-type heels, you arrive just in time to see Ethel and Esme shouting magic stuff at each other while crazy lights dance around the room. The lights become brighter, and you are forced to shield your eyes, but between your fingers you see some terrifying things.

And then it all stops - the lights, the screaming and the floating Esme, who lands flat on her bum. You rush to her side at once.

'Esme, are you okay?'

Your heart pounds as she stares at you blankly for a moment, then leaps with hope as she blinks a few times.

'Is it lunch time yet?'

The voice is small and faint, but unmistakably Esme's. You hug your friend tightly, relief coursing over you.

'Ahem,' coughs Ethel deliberately, staring out of a dusty window. 'This is all very sweet, but we have a problem.'

With Esme in arm you scamper over to the window, where you are rather alarmed to see a huge gash splitting the sky open, with a gigantic, terrible lizard-type eye peering through it. 'That doesn't look good,' you remark limply.

'Yes, when your little red friend read the incantation, she opened a dimensional rift through which all the evil of the universe will soon pour. Now, I'm pretty sure there's a way to stop it, but I'm going to need your help.'

You gleefully set about chasing after and stomping on spiders of various shades and size. Esme joins in with relish. A particularly juicy arachnid scuttles off down a long book-lined corridor, and you eagerly give chase, only quietening your enthused whoops when a furious librarian shushes you with a long, bony finger.

You reach the end of the corridor, where you are surprised to find a gigantic spider wearing a tatty burnished crown and sitting on a frayed satin pillow. Could this be the fabled spider king?

'An excellent choice!' beams the hobgoblin in congratulatory tones. 'This power is especially effective against water-based stuff. That'll be 1,000 gold, please.'

'Oh, okay. Well, the only budget power I currently offer is zombie power. Just how much gold //do// you have?'

<<if $gotGold>>'We ''have'' 10 gold!' you beam proudly.

You feel yourself slip between the pages of reality, the universe rearranges itself around you, and then...

You stand at the very peak of the third mountain of Carn. Only fifty feet above you the eye spreads like a virus, infecting suns, devouring stars, and watching, always watching.

The world below is lost to you. Any feeling, any emotion you might once have known has been stripped away from you like meat from a carcass, and now there is only this.

You watch the eye, and the eye watches you, and for the longest time there is nothing else...

You strike up a conversation with a harpy in the queue, who explains that she is buying flour to bake a cake for Harpycon, an annual gathering of local harpys. The cake is to be given as a prize to the coolest harpy.

'Oh, cool,' you say. 'So this new windmill, pretty swanky, huh?'

'Yes! To be honest, I liked the old one just fine, but this one's so much more convenient! I mean, whenever I have to travel between the orphanage and that scary witch lady's house, I take the slightly shorter route and POW! It's right there. Plus the flour is cheap, so I can make super-big cakes.'

'Well, nice meeting you!' you smile, and leave awkwardly, because you're bad at finishing conversations.

Before too long you find yourself outside Ethel Frogbottle's rundown old cottage. Weeds threaten to devour the ramshackle structure, and the glass is broken in most of the windows. A faint, indeterminate odour pervades the still air.

You pluck a volume from the pile at random. It's 'Sky Pirate Elena', a semi-epic unfinished work which started a few summers ago, and which you come back to every now and then to add a chapter. Esme does most of the pictures and you do most of the words.

The opening chapters concern Elena's early years; a happy childhood growing up in a seaside town with her socialite mother and inventor father, days spent keenly studying and nights spent with her best friend Octavia riding a mechanical whale her father had built. Then her life is torn apart by tragedy - a winged demon eats her mother and leaves her father wounded and unable to fulfil his dream of building a flying ship that runs on clouds (neither yourself or Esme are of a particularly technical mind). Bent on revenge, Elena works tirelessly on her father's plans, then takes off to battle the demon with Octavia.

Then, a twist! As Elena prepares to fire her cannons directly into the exposed brain of the demon, Octavia sabotages the attack. It turns out she is the demon's daughter! Elena abandons ship and goes to ground, but then Octavia kills the demon and sets off to find her friend. They have a big argument, make up and fly around the world pirating stuff and fighting giant puppets which the demon left behind (or something). It all gets a bit unclear at this point, but there's plenty of high adventure and a good time is had by all.

'Crumbs, it must be nearly dinnertime!' exclaims Esme. Looking up you see it has got rather dark, so you run along to dinner.

'AIEEE!' screams the spider king as you stomp on his big ugly face. 'What did I ever do to you?'

Only a few minutes of lunch remain, so you quickly snarfle some snowfish sandwiches (your favourite) while a shiny-eyed Esme recounts your spider-stomping adventure to some first-years.

As the words leave your lips, Esme's head thuds dejectedly to her desk, and your heart sinks.

'Not even close,' snarls Mistress Honeywell. 'This simply isn't good enough. If it happens again I shall see you in Madam Scrimshaw's office, and I hope you'll pay more attention there.'

'Sorry, miss,' you mutter. And you are, a bit.

Finally the lunch bell rings out from the courtyard, and you quickly make your escape.

Outside, a flushed and slightly out of breath Esme waits impatiently. 'Thank Gaia that's over,' she pouts. 'I thought I was going to die of boredom, literally //die.// So, what do you want to do?'

Trouble soon rears its head in the form of Crystalline Temperstone, the prettiest (and therefore also the meanest) girl in school, and her best friend Roxy Slipstream, who is not quite as pretty (and therefore not quite as mean). The pair taunt you from the sports field, and Esme happily launches herself at Roxy while you face up against Crystalline. A nearby ditch provides the perfect site for a scuffle and you all emerge several minutes later, flushed and sweaty with your uniforms in muddy disarray.

Only a few minutes of lunch remain, so you quickly snarfle some snowfish sandwiches (your favourite) and rub your bruises.

'Of course, miss,' you lie.

'Very well, what did I just say?'

You think hard. 'Something about healing herbs?'

Mistress Honeywell sighs. 'That was almost an hour ago, my girl. What did I say //just now//?'

A flash of red catches your eye, and you see Esme flailing her arms wildly about and scrunching up her freckled face. Presumably she is trying to help you, but what do you decipher from her actions?

You scramble up the tree, Esme close behind. From the top you can see the Wooded Realm in all it's glory. It's actually not that big. To the west you see a second clearing, to the east a generic glade-type area. In the distant north a dim glow catches your eye. Could this be the glow of the (recently) fabled Moontree? Why, yes. Yes it could.

'Hey, is that glow the Moontree?' says Esme excitedly.

'Yeah, I was just thinking that!' you reply while contemplating your next move.<<set $treeclimb = false>>

You traipse along the tunnel, which is surprisingly bat guy free. Weeds hang down from the roof and smack you in the face, which is annoying. Eventually you emerge into a vast cave, it's floor split by a wide chasm that runs wall to wall. A badly-scrawled sign helpfully reads 'BEWAR OF GAP'. On the far side of the chasm you see what can only be described as a plinth, although no column, pedestal, statue, monument or structure rests upon it. Instead, there is something shiny!

'I want that shiny thing!' says a wide-eyed Esme. 'But how to get it?'

<<if $knowFlight>>'You could fly over there!' suggests Esme.

'Yeah, but I can only do it once, remember? We couldn't get back.'

'Oh yeah,' says Esme. 'Dang.'<<else>>'It's not like we can just fly over there,' says Esme.<<endif>>

<<if $gotGrapple>>'We could use the grappling hook I got from that weird ladybird!' you suggest. Luckily Esme knows how to use grappling hooks, and she quickly retrieves the object, which turns out to be a shiny key!<<set $gotKey = true>>

''Item Gained - Shiny Key!''

'What a dumb place to keep a key,' says Esme. 'I mean really, it makes no sense whatsoever.'

'Well, I suppose the bat guys can just glide over and get it, but it makes it hard for anyone else,' you point out.

'Oh yeah, I guess. Well, there's not much else to do here, let's head back to the entrance cavern.'<<else>>Unfortunately, you ''have'' no way of reaching the object, so you are forced to head back to the entrance cavern and do another thing you can do.<<endif>>

'I'll just take a quick look,' you reason, unable to quell your natural curiosity.

You open the book to a random page (although it's probably the page that was last open or one that's been read a lot, it's quite hard to open a book to a random page), and what you see there is more than a tad unsettling. Strange symbols, unlike any language you've ever seen, cover the page, save for a few illustrations, the most eye-catching of which details a weird skull thing:

<html><img src="023.jpg" width="181" height="250"></html>

You suddenly realise that your lips are moving, silently reading the symbols in a tongue you are sure does not belong to this world. You feel unusually light, and your eyes tingle. You are dimly aware of a flash of red bobbing around on the edge of your vision, making an irritating noise, but you are either unable or unwilling to tear your attention from the book.

And then everything turns black, or a colour somewhat darker.

*

'Oblivia? Oblivia!'

You awake to find Esme cradling you in her arms, concern colouring her usually cheerful freckle-face. 'Are you OK?'

'I... I'm fine,' you moan. 'Am I dead?'

'Ahem,' coughs Ethel deliberately, staring out of a dusty window. 'This is all very sweet, but we have a problem.'

With Esme in arm you scamper over to the window, where you are rather alarmed to see a huge gash splitting the sky open, with a gigantic, terrible lizard-type eye peering through it. 'That doesn't look good,' you remark limply.

'I wonder why they call it the End of Places,' whispers Esme as you cross the threshold, carefully stepping over a neat little row of assorted skulls.

'Maybe they just thought it sounded cool,' you shrug.

'Maybe,' says Esme doubtfully.

A dirt trail stretches endlessly before you, jammed tightly between the mountain bases. The peaks of Ebb and Sol pierce the clouds, and between them the eye watches, impassive, unblinking. You can't think of anything to say.

You walk for what seems like an age. The sun falls, its golden rays superseded by a purple light that seeps from the giant split in the sky, infecting the stars, winding glowing threads among the gathered moons and using them to pull itself ever closer.

'Don't look at it,' says Esme, her voice oddly hollow. 'Just keep your eyes on the path.'

A great cave entrance in the face of Ebb draws your attention, and as you peer into the murky depths a snooty vampire leaps out, snarling a bit and flashing her fangs.

'You don't want to go in there!' she warns snootily. 'It are dark, and there be bat guys!'

Lacking the energy to correct her sloppy grammar, you simply reply, 'We're not afraid of any bats!'

'Oh, okay,' she says forlornly. 'Well, sure, I guess if you wants to go in there, then go for it. But don't say I didn't warns ya!' She conveniently scurries away before you have a chance to say anything else.

Peering into the cave, you realise it really is very dark. Also there appears to be a bunch of super-muscly bat guys who look eager to beat you up. All in all, it looks like a bad bat cave to go caving in.

You approach the run-down orphanage as the last rays of sunlight leave the sky.

'And what sort a'time d'ye call this?' tuts Sister Beatrice as you enter the dining room, where the other girls are all assembled and waiting to eat. You still haven't figured out Sister Beatrice's accent, and you sense this is the wrong time to ask.

'Sorry, Sister,' you mumble. 'We got caught up.'

'Oh, I'm sure ye did. A six-week o' glorious summer stretched 'afore ye, and ye can't even make it back in time for supper.'

You're not sure there's any correlation there, but you smell whiskey on her breath and know better than to press the point.

Dinner is served, and you tuck into boiled firechicken and a big pile of mountain sprouts, washed down with a tall glass of moonfruit juice, which you're pretty sure has been diluted. Some conversation is permitted during mealtime, and you tell the assembled girls of your special assignment.

'Crumbs!' says Matilda Longstaff, the palest of the orphans. 'You're going to get eaten for sure!'

Later, your sleep is interrupted by dreams of being chased through the woods by witches, sprites and elves, all brandishing oversized cutlery and after your gizzard.

'Let's disturb the sleeping figure,' you suggest brightly.

'Are you crazy?' hisses Esme. 'It's probably a ghost, or a pirate, or a ghost pirate! Let's get out of here!'

A quick game of orc, goblin, fimir decides in your favour, and you approach the sheeted form with your breath held. 'Um, hello?' you say, but there is no response. You shake the figure's shoulder-bump, but still nothing. You're inclined to stop here, but you don't want Esme to think you're a wuss, so finally you tug at the sheet, which falls away to reveal...

A ghost pirate! It wails and moans and starts chucking stuff at you, so you quickly lift the trapdoor and throw Esme below before jumping down yourself, slamming it behind you. Everyone knows ghosts can't get through trapdoors.

An oil lamp casts a warm glow over the generic corridor you find yourself in. Unmarked doors lead, um, port, and, er... starboard? A rude statue stands at the far end of the corridor, but you manage to avert your gaze.

''Item Gained - Old Map''<<set $gotMap = true>>

'Sweet deal!' chimes Esme. 'Now lets get out of here, the ship could be crawling with zombies!'

You run from the room, knocking over a barrel in your haste. The powder spills towards the oil lamp, and then you realise it is gunpowder and therefore this is very bad! You leap up through the trapdoor, surprising the ghost, and leap from the deck as the ship explodes, propelling you forward to land on your faces at the waterside.

'My name is Oblivia Firespoon,' you say truthfully, 'and I'm trying to save the world, but the thing is, I need your egg.'

The Moonbird considers this for a tense moment before replying. 'I am the last of the Moonbirds, at the end of my life, and this is the only egg I'll ever lay. It can only hatch in a place of pure darkness, and this nest at night is the last such spot in Carn, so if it is removed my kind will die out. But okay, sure, if you need it.'

'Oh, really?' you say, surprised.

'Yeah, s'cool,' says the Moonbird. 'But before you go, will you be the last to hear my song? It's quite short.'

'Well, I'm in a bit of a hurry,' you say, then seeing the hurt expression on the Moonbird's face hurriedly add, 'but of course I'd love to hear your song!'

'Ok, sweet,' says the Moonbird, before clearing its throat and falling silent.

After a few awkward moments, you say 'Um... the song?'

'Oh yes, the song!' smiles the Moonbird. 'Here we go, then.'

<html><img src="018.jpg" width="413" height="550"></html>

And then the Moonbird begins to sing; a sweet, slow, mournful song that washes over your senses and puddles in your soul. Discordant harmonies creep in, dancing in and out of the melody like the ghosts of fallen warriors, and as you stand transfixed lights twinkle in each and every tree as the weird and wonderful inhabitants of the Wooded Realm peek between the leaves to watch. The song lasts forever, and then it is over, and the Moonbird lays down to sleep, and not to wake.

'What was all that squawking about?' asks Esme as you reach the base of the tree. 'Have you been crying?'

'Good call,' you say, trying the key in the door. 'Hey, it won't turn!'

'I HATE THIS DOOR!' you cry, giving it a good kick. Your super-strength wins out over the cheap timber and the door promptly disintegrates. Seeing no other doors around, you discard the useless key.

'Eh?' you rub your head, confused.

'As in, you can only wish for more wishes. So, y'know, you can have millions of wishes, but you can't actually //do// anything with them. It's ironic, probably.' With this he flops back into the lamp and falls asleep.

'All finished, are we?' sniffs Ethel disapprovingly. 'Well, the pots do look fairly clean, I suppose. Tell you what, go and tidy up the attic for me and then you can run along home.'

You traipse up a rickety staircase to the dark, dusty attic, where flittery somethings scurry into cobwebbed corners to peer out at you. Glass tanks hold odd shapes that you'd rather not look at too closely, and spidery etchings adorn the walls. Esme shudders a lot.
