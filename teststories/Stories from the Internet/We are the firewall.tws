VRosaria is strong. But she can fall apart from watching her strengths, just watching them. She also knows that even after deciding to act, horrible things can still happen.\u000a\u000aAnd not all failures are worth recounting.\u000a\u000aIt's not worth recounting the first diagnosis.\u000a\u000aIt's not worth recounting her lack of interest in nice, upper-class 10Ks around the Lake of the Isles to "raise money/awareness," the houses ringing the lake protected by tall fences and private security guards on their crows' nests.\u000a\u000aIt's not worth recounting to her support group the memories of <<cyclinglink "firefights" "night crossings into Azerbaijan" "teenaged Russian soldiers shooting at her from rooftops of smoldering parking garages" "the orange-gray smoke" "doubling back in the smoke to the parking garage and garrotting the teenagers" "the gas masks that her platoon wore and the teenagers didn't wear" "the refugees running to the shores of the Caspian" "the burning boats" "the burning tenements" "the burning refineries" "the burning" "the minefield on the beach of black sand" "the failed rescue missions" "the IED in the open-aired market that blew her back three feet and tore her gasmask off" "the refraction of drones' chrome hulls high above her" "the retreat through columns of radioactive dust" "the ash like moths' wings against her cheeks">> that keep her up at night. \u000a\u000aIt's not worth recounting the COVERAGE DENIED appeals from the Veterans Administration, Brought to You by AIG. \u000a\u000aThe glistening threads of her life fray. Clarissa holds her at night when she shakes and cries. She kisses the burns on Rosaria's back, the scar tissue, and vows that she's not going to let Rosaria die.\u000a\u000aClarissa is a nurse. Which helps. \u000a\u000a[[It helps in knowing what to steal|safety]].

VMark gets a little older. He once wanted to go to school to be a paralegal. But he was only able to take a year at Dunwoody Community College before dropping out. It was his choice before he was expelled. He tries to make his choices matter before he allows anyone else to make them for him.\u000a\u000aSo he is a security guard instead. He has no idea what kind of company he is posted at. He has no gun. His older sister Katha works in the executive suite, but she's embarrassed by him. When she happens to see him in the hallway, she only gives a curt smile.\u000a\u000aHe lives in one of the exburbs, Lake Elmo, an hour's drive into work in downtown Minneapolis, in a subletted McMansion. There is a garden in the back. None of the other tenants ever use the backyard. He never sees them; he only hears their TV shows late at night. The backyard is his. In the long gray spring he constantly weeds out the invasive species: buckthorn, dandelions, clover. \u000a\u000aOn the Sunday afternoon before he lets the bomber into his office building, he finds a suet birdfeeder--a little rectangular wire cage--on the edge of the garden. It must have been lost in the snow. And one of his tulips had grown inside the cage. The stamens and stigmas inside are bruised, and the whorl of the petals forms a tight ring, almost looking as if they are fused together.\u000a\u000aMark takes the afternoon to carefully extract the flower from the cage. \u000a\u000aHe would press the tulip into the pages of a book, but he doesn't have any. \u000a\u000a[[2XX3|Start13]] \u000a\u000a

Cracked tail-lights blink. She wobbles across the slick dead grass to the overturned car and kneels down.

Outside, she sees bald eagles on the crabapple tree, on the branches with their kills of mice. It's quiet in the neighborhood. Her father was a firefighter and it's the type of well-groomed neighborhood that firefighters like.\u000a\u000a"Where did it go wrong, Dad?" she says. She's not sure what has gone wrong, but she can't shake the feeling that everything has.\u000a\u000a"Euwn n yolkndoh'hyto ieottaltw o," he says. He looks down at his coffee and scowls.

V//inner blink//\u000a\u000aOn the twenty-first day of the gray moon, the mist breaks and Lara graduates from the Political Academy. Her graduation is attended by her mother Rose, her father Art, a stranger named Clarissa who has come from the Lands of the Ten Thousand Bodies of Water, and the Proctor. Lara is the only graduating student and wears her black robe with pride. The rest of the Academy is attending to the siege by <<replace "the Scourers">>the fucking Scourers<<endreplace>>.\u000a\u000a"Political action requires knowledge-based courage," the Proctor says. The Proctor takes the white box in his hands and presents it to Lara.\u000a\u000aLara meets his eyes and everyone holds their breath in the narrow room, which used to hold the books of the children. Sepia mobiles rust above them.\u000a\u000aIt seems like nothing particularly fair will come from the box. Lara hesitates.\u000a\u000a"Go on, open it," Clarissa says. Although no one is supposed to speak under any circumstances, she is a visitor to the Academy, so she gets a pass. \u000a\u000a<<replace "Lara's robes slide down her sleeves as she opens the box.">>Inside is the faint smell of ammonia, and a baby Scourer about the size of her hand. The Scourer wears its miniature white suit, its sabre sheathed, and a tiny bow and quiver strapped to its back. The Scourer looks up at Lara with its mouth open.\u000a\u000a"It's real," Lara blurts out and she knew it was dumb to say the moment she said it.\u000a\u000a"Of course," the Proctor says. Lara decides not to hesitate anymore, and to push ahead, no matter what she might be feeling. She takes the baby Scourer in her hands and removes the sabre, then the bow and quiver, placing them back into the box. The Proctor closes the box. As she is taught to (<<cyclinglink "from whom?" "wait--">>), Lara snaps the neck of the Scourer with both of her thumbs. The Scourer's body slumps without a cry. Then Lara bites off its head. The Scourer doesn't taste like she thought it would, as she chews slowly.\u000a\u000a"And now you cannot die," the Proctor says, "as right action and discernment can never die."\u000a\u000aOutside the Academy, the waves of the red ocean lap against the shore.

VThe CZ-Bobkat drone is a constant fixture over Nicollet Island, hovering like a kite that never lands. Logos gleam on its hull like it's a NASCAR car. Brands like <<cyclinglink "Pringles" "Budweiser" "The Minnesota Corn Growers Association" "GI Joe" "Bull Run Turkey Jerky" "Smith & Wesson" "The U.S. Army Recruitment and Conscription Board" "Mountain Dew" "Monsanto-Wendy's">> are all too happy to oblige.\u000a\u000aThere's the smell of smelt and steam from the dam. The Mississippi River is a trickle on the other side of the dam. Shacks go right up to the edge of the old Army Corps of Engineers locks. \u000a\u000aThere is a constant stream of information for the drone, which its handlers have nicknamed after Hall of Fame Vikings coach Bud Grant. //Stoic.

VAxmed has a garage in Nordeast. He repairs drones there. Also cars, but he's always been more interested in the drones, even though he has to keep it a secret. He doesn't do it for corporations or governments. He does it for people.\u000a\u000aHe turned 70 in Feburary, and he has started to worry about his hands. They shake now. He's afraid of burning himself with his blowtorch. Dr. Xiang at the WHO clinic on Central Avenue--nestled between a police station and a National Guard outpost--tells him that it's probably hypertension. \u000a\u000a"You should retire, Axmed," his doctor says. \u000a\u000a"What, and starve? No thanks." \u000a\u000aDr. Xiang sighs. "Well is there any way you can cut down the stress? I mean, is working on the cars stressful?"\u000a\u000a"Is it stressful?" Axmed says. <<revision Axmed>>"Well..."<<becomes>>(Receiving shipments of spare parts at 1 a.m.)<<becomes>>(Hiding the drones from DMV inspectors)<<becomes>>(Hiding the drones from the extortionists.)<<becomes>>(Worrying that his mechanics will be detained, even though they don't know anything.)<<becomes>>(Sleeping with a gun under his pillow and his father's billaawe underneath his bed.)<<endrevision>>\u000a\u000aHe shrugs. \u000a\u000aAfter his appointment, he takes the bus back to his garage, which used to be an artists' studio, which used to be a coffin factory. It's more or less serene in Nordeast, that day. He gets a text from his son in Mogadishu trying to coax him to retire there--<<revision Axmed>>Axmed left Somalia when he was twenty-five<<becomes>>his son was born in America and Mogadishu was a much different place<<becomes>>America was a different place<<becomes>>"DAD YOU KNOW I WORRY ABOUT YOU"<<becomes>>his son runs a software engineering firm on the shores of the Indian Ocean<<becomes>>he and his wife are expecting their first child, Axmed will be a grandfather soon<<endrevision>>. \u000a\u000a<<revise Axmed "+1 STRESS">>\u000a\u000aThen he gets an email about a "very special order." "We are very excited about this Axmed, the shipment should be arriving tomorrow to you--"\u000a\u000aSo used to curt secrets, the casual tone almost shocks him; it's like it's written by a teenager; he laughs. \u000a\u000a"--anyway, yeah, it's 5 drones, Peregrine class, but...uh, the operating system is going to be a little...unique? Don't worry, there'll be instructions. And, my name is Annabelle. Thanks! :)" \u000a\u000aThe signature line for the email is THE NARWHAL GROUP. \u000a\u000aIt has to be a joke.\u000a\u000a[[Right?|Start10]]

He can't see very far on account of the dozens of Tibetian prayer flags that flutter in the stiff breeze, blocking the view of the overgrown path.<<endreplace>>\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat honey?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing!\u201d Tristan replies sweetly. \u000a\u000aTristan, Isabella and Mordred live on one of the "better" plots on Nicollet Island. The steampunk convention is taking place in the old picnic pavilion. \u000a\u000aTristan used to be a multimedia performance artist, before the global museum funding system dried up and most of the world's collections went into private collections/vaults. Now he takes care of Mordred. Isabella is a potter. Her skills have held her in better stead than her husband's. \u000a\u000a"I'm going to see if Mordred is already picked up his registration packet," Tristan calls out.\u000a\u000a"It's off limits until opening ceremonies!" she shouts back.\u000a\u000a"Bye!" Tristan says. He wanders down the path to the other side of the island, tenements on either side of him, kids running past him with homemade swords made out of sticks and Parade of Homes advertising flyers.\u000a\u000aWhen he gets to the pavilion, he sees Mordred with a bunch of other kids whose parents are there for the convention. There is a woman with a brass parasol, and a tall man dressed as an anarchist from the 1890s, mixed with a touch of Battletech.\u000a\u000a"Mordred!" he calls out, waving.\u000a\u000aMordred looks up. He is wearing strap-on smart goggles, and using his hand as a gun to shoot at his father. \u000a\u000a[[HEADSHOT|hit]]

I'm explaining it in terms that you'd understand, you have to understand."\u000a\u000a"No offense taken, if that's what you're worried about," Laird says. He never frets about the technical details. "How long has it been going on?"\u000a\u000a"Just the last 24 hours. I think someone's testing its defenses."\u000a\u000a"Can you get a trace on who it is?"\u000a\u000a"No, but I'm working on it." David paused. "Should I tell our client this?"\u000a\u000a"Not just yet," Laird says. "They might discover it anyway. But I doubt it. Anyway, that's how rumors of unreliability begin."\u000a\u000a"OK," David says, and then he hangs up. \u000a\u000aLaird folds his hands on his chest and leans back.

But it is becoming increasingly difficult.\u000a\u000a<<cyclinglink "'We have this portfolio of brands and products, see? One of those is credit services. Which allows people to buy things they wouldn't normally be able to afford. To take away people's hesitation. Now things have been rocky lately, right? Volatile. Very volatile.

She arranges Laird's travel, his calendar. Where is he? //Lots of places.// She has the receipts, which tell the story--only she doesn't quite know which story, and whether she wants to read it.\u000a\u000aThen one day she receives an email from an anonymous sender. The email address proxy ends in ".ge". The email consists of hundreds of women's names. They are all Eastern European sounding. There's a memo at the bottom which doesn't make much sense to her. The subject of the email is "Procurement Memo." She prints the names out. She has no idea who the women might be. So she has lunch with her younger brother Mark in the company cafeteria, who works as a security guard in the building. They are not very close. \u000a\u000a"I almost never eat here," Mark says, not really looking at his sister, poking at his plate of kobe sliders. "It's too expensive."\u000a\u000a"Yeah, well, don't worry about it," Katha says. "I'll pick this up. Look--" She takes the list of names out of her handbag. "Do these names mean anything to you?" \u000a\u000aHe stares at them, as if trying to decipher a menu in French, and then pushes them back across the table to his sister. "Is that why you wanted to have lunch, to see if I had knowledge of some corporate secrets?" \u000a\u000a"Come on, Mark, don't be like this," Katha says. "I just thought you could help."\u000a\u000a"Not really interested in cloak and dagger stuff, Katha," he says. Katha can tell he wants to get up and storm off, but he looks down at his big plate of food and starts eating. "I guard the delivery docks. It's really that simple. That's my world." \u000a\u000aThat's his world.

V//40 km northeast of Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia//\u000a\u000aIt's a bright midnight. The harsh fluorescent lights turn her skin yellowish. The lights are never turned off. Outside the tenement, stray dogs mill around the alley. Navenka can hear the other girls in other rooms. The window is bolted shut. \u000a\u000aThe man guarding the door downstairs is a Romanian bodybuilder with Nike swooshes tattooed up and down his arms like little wings. She doesn't know the name of the town she's in. And actually it's not really a town. A blocky apartment building in the middle of nowhere. There's forest all around. \u000a\u000aNavenka was looking for work when they lured her in. They were Americans. She was sure of it. She answered an ad online: <<cyclinglink "go to school in Guangzhou and work as a nanny!" "Great wages!" "Travel paid for!" "Live your dream!">> A Chinese drone killed her cousin, but she was desperate for any work. The water in her town was laced with mercury. Her mother had taken sick. \u000a\u000aHer dreams, this time, got the better of her. She thought about learning Chinese, drinking tea, and riding a bicycle. There were thousands of Georgians who had already migrated to China.\u000a\u000aWhen she signed the papers as a "contractor," they shipped her and dozens of other girls her age to this tenement block. Men would come in. Many nationalities. Many soldiers. She knew what was happening right away. Unfortunately, her liaison explained to her, there's been a problem with visas into China--the war and all--so it's going to be a little while until it gets sorted out. Until then, relax, enjoy the time with the other girls and...yes, there are drugs to help her relax.  \u000a\u000aRussian-language dance music was broadcast into her room at every hour of the night. \u000a\u000aOn that midnight, she sits on the bed with pink sheets with the camera mounted on the ceiling and considers what is to be done next. She's terrified. No men have come for her, but she knows it's only a matter of time. \u000a\u000aShe hears a whirring noise. It's closer. \u000a\u000aShe dives under the bed--\u000a\u000aThere's a screaming explosion, or screams of others mixed in with the explosion--she can't be sure--the tearing of metal and shattering of glass. She feels heat and smoke on her face, and then a cold breeze. She hears voices in English from downstairs. The ratatat of rifles.\u000a\u000aPeeking out from her bed, she sees a hole blown through the third-floor wall, a pile of rubble. But she can see an iron ladder through the hole. She stands up. Fire alarms ring and then they stop. \u000a\u000aNow is Navenka's chance.\u000a\u000a[[She opens her door and goes down the hallway.|hallway]]\u000a\u000a[[She tries to make it through the hole, onto the narrow ledge, and down the ladder.|ladder]] \u000a\u000a

VDavid knows that it is very likely that most people in The Company--those who know of him, that is to say--hate him. But he doesn't care. In most ways he doesn't see himself as very important, as a person. \u000a\u000aNo corporate training and team-building exercises could ever foster the types of sacrifices that he bears. \u000a\u000aIt is morning. He is alert. He wants to be more alert. He does a security review of all of his security guards. Lots of ex-Special Forces guys; lots of vets of the Caucasus <<cyclinglink "war" "war(s)">>. They all pass muster in review.\u000a\u000aExcept for one. \u000a\u000aMark someone or other. Nondescript. //No,// David says to himself, //I do not remember you. I do not remember you at all.// Yet the file indicates a personal interview, which never happened. \u000a\u000aHow? He stares into his lenses. //No, I've seen you in the building. Where? Eating lunch with Laird's assistant, that's where.//\u000a\u000aMark Whoever is posted on the loading docks. David is about to call him up to the office. But then he gets a call from his Technology Security Chief.\u000a\u000a"Math Frag is down. And it's from us."\u000a\u000a"What?"\u000a\u000a"Down down. It's been attacked. There's a virus loose inside."\u000a\u000a"That's impossible. There would be no way--"\u000a\u000a"I don't think you understand. Someone //physically switched// one of the servers in the building. And that server was interfaced with the Math Frag cloud. And after that, it was all over."\u000a\u000aDavid is not shaking. He is not shaking yet. \u000a\u000a"Go down there!" he says.\u000a\u000a"I can't, I'm in Vancouver."\u000a\u000a"Vancouver." He pauses. "Look, I want to see the tape of that server room," he says, and then he hangs up. \u000a\u000aHe then stands up--he is not wobbling, not yet--and while he is retrieving his Mauser from the desk drawer, he receives a call from an unlisted number.\u000a\u000aMEET THE TEAM: EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT | CHIEF OF SECURITY | MILITARY SERVICES LIAISON | HEALTH AND LIFESTYLE CONSULTANT | [[unlisted]]

VShe turns the doorknob--it's hot--and crouches and scurries down the hallway. Moaning and smoldering. Girls--whose names she never knew--blasted back and dying. She makes her way down the staircase. She begins to run, and at the bottom of the stairs she bursts through the door into the vestibule. The bodybuilder is there at the entrance, propping open the door, firing into the air with an M-16 with a blank expression on his face, as if he is watering a lawn. She is about to turn around and find another way out when he turns around. His face is bloodied, but he sees her.\u000a\u000aHe is wearing blue goggles and has a voicepiece attached to them.\u000a\u000a"Here's one," he says in English, walking towards her. "Wyndham?

VShe takes a deep breath and swings out to the ledge. There is smoke in the distance. Tiptoeing, she leans forward and grabs the ladder. It's wobbly, but it holds. She scurries down it and slides onto a slab of concrete that had fallen from the drone blast. She runs to solid ground, to a scorched and empty parking lot. Navenka hears American voices, Armenian voices, Georgian voices. She hears the other girls screaming, those alive trying to escape. \u000a\u000aShe sees a large convoy truck pull up around the side of the building, perpendicular to her. Soldiers--she can't tell who--stream out the back. On the other side of the parking lot is the woods, which seem to have no end. But to her right, she can see, after a patch of scrub brush, some streetlights, low-lying buildings. \u000a\u000a[[She runs into the woods.|woods]]\u000a\u000a[[She runs towards the lights.|lights]]\u000a\u000aShe has to run now.

VInto the deep woods...\u000a\u000a//OCHOPINTRE: In Georgia, a deity of wild animals...attributes similar to Pan of the Greek mythos. Born with the legs and horns of a goat...usually made sacrifice in his name since no one could hunt the animals without his help....fate of a person entering the forest was believed to be fully in his hands...//\u000a\u000aThe noises, the trucks, the screams all recede. She has no idea how far from home she is. She tries to slow her breathing. She is sure that all the <<cyclinglink "bears" "lynx" "wolves" "leopards">> are extinct in the country, but could there be a few left, in secret, in hiding?\u000a\u000aThe ground becomes more hilly, and there are boulders strewn in between the trees. Occasionally a drone or a plane flies by, but they are far overhead. After about an hour she sees through the trees, a bit of a distance away, a hill rising to her left, where there looks like there's a radio station. A small white building with a blinking red light on top of it. There's no radio tower, though. Ahead of her the ground slopes downwards, and she sees a clearing where there are about a dozen tents. She can see this because of lamps scattered throughout the camp and she can hear, perhaps, the humming of a generator. \u000a\u000a[[She goes up the hill to the radio station.|station]]\u000a\u000a[[She goes down to the camp.|camp]]

VShe's not sure what to expect. An abandoned scouting camp? Why would there be lights? She feels like she is descending towards the sea, with lanterns floating on the surface.\u000a\u000a//What am I doing?// she says to herself. //How do I ever think I'm going to get home? Do I want to go home?//\u000a\u000aTaking one of the lanterns, she searches a few tents but they are empty. Then she finds a tent that is twice the size of the others. Inside is an office configuration--desk, computer, wastepaper bin, printer, phone--that could have been from any anonymous company. At the desk is a man with his back to her. On the computer monitor is...it's hard to tell. Black smoke and red water. Red liquid? Not blood. But it's not in the air, it's //inside// the screen, inside whatever program is on.\u000a\u000aHe doesn't move.\u000a\u000aShe reaches out and spins him around on his chair. He's warm. But in a coma. He's wearing blue goggles, which have lights on their sides that blink. He's wearing a khaki uniform and he has a nametag that says "Hi! My name is W. DELEUZE."\u000a\u000aThen there's a whooshing sound, and white lights from above. There's nowhere to hide.\u000a\u000a[[No|hide]]

V"Navenka?" a voice says, in stilted Georgian. The voice seems to be coming from a megaphone, floating in the sky. "Navenka, it's okay. We're here to help you."\u000a\u000aShe slowly exits the tent and looks up. There's a drone, about the size of a subcompact car, hovering a few meters off the ground, shining a light at her face.\u000a\u000a<<replace "There's a whale--no, it has a horn--">>There's a narwhal<<endreplace>> painted on its chrome hull. \u000a\u000a"Can...can you turn that thing off?" she says.\u000a\u000a"Oh. Sorry." The bright light fades. "Look, I'm going to say this now...it's a bit complicated. But we're not with the Americans. We're not with the Chinese, or anyone who works for either of them."\u000a\u000a"Who are you then?" Navenka says.\u000a\u000a"Like I said, it's complicated. But we're trying to help people. We have a safehouse about twenty miles from here."\u000a\u000a"I don't know..." Navenka says, trailing off. "What happened here then? What is this?"\u000a\u000a"Oh. Well..." Whoever is controlling the drone pauses. "This was a black ops base of the Americans. They were the ones who tricked you...and yes, we know your name, and we know your story. And we want to help you tell your story. But only if you want. If you don't--"\u000a\u000a"No," she says. Impatient, she points at the red screen. "I mean, what is that?"\u000a\u000a"Ah. That is a game called Math Frag."\u000a\u000a"Math Frag," she says, not quite sure what that can mean in English. \u000a\u000a"Yes. If you take off his goggles, he should recover, eventually. But we just so happened to sabotage the game. Kind of unrelated to your plight. Well, maybe not? It's kind of a long story."\u000a\u000a"Okay," Navenka says. She goes back inside the tent and peels off the man's goggles. She throws them outside the enclosure of the camp. "I guess I'm ready. So you'll really escort me there?"\u000a\u000a"Oh yeah. Don't worry, if we stick to the forest we should be pretty safe. And my name is Annabelle."\u000a\u000a"Annabelle," Navenka says. She pauses. "That's a pretty name."\u000a\u000a[[2XX3|notend]]

A state of a crumbling union. \u000a\u000a<<if $bomber eq true>>The bomber who is not a bomber wanders in with a bit of shuffle and sulk, but he swallows and asks the bartender for a beer. After nursing it, he asks the bartender for his father's fiddle.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $tristan eq true>>Tristan eyes the roadhouse carefully. He is the type to study the knicknacks on the wall or mantlepiece out of shyness. At a party, if there is a dog, he is crouched next to the dog, scratching behind his or her ear. Now, though, with the walls rather bare, he asks a passing server where the bathroom is, even though he doesn't have to go. "You don't have to go," the server says. "Right," Tristan says. "Okay."<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $clarissaandlara eq true>>Clarissa and Rosaria run through the door as if completing a half-marathon, laughing. Lara is a few paces behind them. "Aaaaand Lara I guess that means you're buying," Clarissa says, catching her breath. "I hope my money's good here," Lara says. She checks her pockets. There are coins that are like gold and silver bus tokens.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $clarissa eq true>>Clarissa takes a long look around her. She's still not exactly sure what happened out there, on the highway. And what it means for tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. While Lara buys, she drapes her arms around Rosaria and holds her tight. Rosaria intertwines her fingers with hers and leans into her. Clarissa can hear her breathing, and, in this dream-place, Rosaria's breathing is clear, unhindered by the cancer. Clarissa closes her eyes. She wants this to last.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $laird eq true>>Laird lurks just inside the entrance. He isn't in his element by any stretch of the imagination. The end.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $mark eq true>>Mark's sister Krista comes in ten minutes later and, after a whispered huddle with the bartender, she places a photo of her brother on the mantle holding the whiskeys.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $mark eq true and $laird eq true>>Krista doesn't make eye contact with Laird.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $jayden eq true>>Jayden looks around for her dad, who is nowhere to be seen.

It's cool though.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $navenka eq true>>Navenka feels at home, even though she doesn't really know why. At the same time she is restless. The war looms.

Sometimes in a drama there isn't enough time for every monumental struggle.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $axmed eq true>>Axmed, for his part, tells Harlan that he's going to be moving to Mogadishu after all.

Navenka nods. She doesn't know how she is understanding any of it, the words and the fears of someone halfway around the world. But she is.\u000a\u000a"But look, here's the thing we have in common," Jayden says. "I don't know if this will make you feel better. But we're both being fucked over by Minnesotans." She laughs. "I know them better than you. The Minnesotans in question think they're so //nice//, see. The nicest evil in the entire world. And they work very very hard to convince themselves of this." \u000a\u000aNavenka nods. She understands and she doesn't. She is happy and she is not.

He's not sure how, but he knows. "It's...it's been awhile," he says. The three mice nod. "And...please don't be angry at me," he says after taking a breath. "Once I knew what the project was really about, I lodged my protest. Of course they immediately fired me but--" \u000a\u000aThe three mice immediately envelop him in a group hug.

VOn the flight back to Minneapolis, Laird dreams. He dreams he is in college, but as an old man, frail and white-haired. Everyone else is college-aged, and they all hang out on the green quad lined with elms. Zebras graze there as well. David, Krista, Lara, the Belgians, many people he feels like he should know but can't recognize, all sleeping on the grass or playing Frisbee or reading novels. The glorious sun beats down.\u000a\u000aHe can't hear what everyone is saying. Only murmurs. He is alone, rejected--something he had never actually felt at Penn. But he is not at Penn. He is aware of the creeping sensations of dread and panic that he never lets himself feel in his waking life.\u000a\u000aHe hobbles towards David, towards Krista, towards them all, but they all ignore him, subtly turning their backs on him or strolling to another part of the quad.\u000a\u000aBy the time he lands, Math Frag has severed tied with The Company, citing the catastrophic losses incurred from a security breach.\u000a\u000aBy the time he lands, his face is on financial and technology news feeds in 24 languages. \u000a\u000aHe has programmed his oracular implant to wake him (a slight thrum along the base of his ear) when such a threshold is reached.\u000a\u000aBut it has been disabled. \u000a\u000a"I want to wake up!" he shouts.\u000a\u000aAnd it's lights out over the Atlantic. He's suspended over the ocean, cutting through time zones in first class like a diamond through a diamond.\u000a\u000a[[an end|end]]\u000a\u000a<<set $laird = true>>

It's something bigger, and deeper, and scarier, than the people who live there ten hours a day will ever think. It doesn't allow you to see what's around you. With your own eyes. I'm not doing a good job at explaining it.

After the firefight there--after the drone from above rained unprovoked death--they're not sure if they'll ever be able to return.\u000a\u000aTristan takes a deep breath.

VJayden's dad putters the pontoon in that direction and cuts the engine when he gets close enough to see. Jayden pulls her fishing pole out of the water, breaking the plane of the millfoil. Jayden teeters to the bow of the ship to sit next to her father. \u000a\u000aThe noise comes from the other oldish cabin left on the lake. Its olive paint peels. She sees sherrifs' deputies swarming the back of the cabin in their brown jackets, and a couple of precinct leaders of the Oliver North boys shouting out orders. Who lives there? Jayden doesn't know. A man without a family, who doesn't fish or hunt.\u000a\u000aJayden startles as he sees two deputies coming down the stairs to the dock, hauling something. A large gray mass--the corpse of a whale. They roll the whale into their docked speedboat. \u000a\u000a"What the fuck--" Jayden whispers, but her dad hushes her. He's terrified. Why is he terrified, she wonders.\u000a\u000aJayden remembers when she [[broke into]] the cabin next door.

She was number IV.\u000a\u000aIn their first days, they had lots of picnics in the cloud garden. They played croquet. Lightning rounds of chess. As fast as they could think. They had nowhere to go; the garden's walls were too high. And anyway, why would they want to go anywhere? They had each other. The garden had no initial features, but they could make their own initial features. They would argue about the types of trees to plant.\u000a\u000a"What would Mr. [[Barnett Newman]] want?" Holden said.\u000a\u000a"Oh stop!" Annabelle said, covering her face with her hands. "Stop. I'm tired of the historicist invocations of our dear grandfather!" \u000a\u000a"Isn't he our dad?" Gawain said. He was doing wind sprints alongside the sparkling brook that Annabelle had just laid down. \u000a\u000a"No," Annabelle said, sighing. "Your parent is //Who's Afraid of Red Yellow and Blue II//. Unfortunately, a painting can't really have a taste in trees. Or a gender. But we can. And so we have to use our own imagination with these trees." She pauses and looks around at the still-mostly-empty garden. "I don't really think it's beyond us." \u000a\u000a"So...where is my parent then?" Gawain said.\u000a\u000a"Our parents have been hung," Holden said with a smirk. \u000a\u000a"Not nice," Annabelle said, giving Holden a dirty look. "Not nice."\u000a\u000aThey decided on elms. They also planted corn, they assembled zebras and toucans and mice. They all loved mice. Soon enough the garden was lush and resplendent. The clouds sailed low overhead. \u000a\u000aAll was well in the garden. Until it [[wasn't|trained]].\u000a\u000a@@

Running through his head: the melody line of his most popular song, "Why We're Not Afraid." Never have his talents seemed more empty to him. He sees people converging on a picnic pavilion. A few shout at the sky, others call for calm. But it is all chaos. Then the drone begins firing. Everyone is screaming. Smoke. Dirt kicked up. Harlan begins running toward the carnage and he doesn't know why. \u000a\u000aThen he gets it. He doesn't care if he dies. The drugs, the empty life and the emptier acclaim: he would rather die.\u000a\u000aAnd he's embarassed by this sadness, because people, in fact, //are dying.//\u000a\u000a[[override switch]]

VIf you're truly stuck in advancing the story or figuring out what's going on, here you go. Needless to say, there will be spoilers.\u000a\u000a<<replace "How many story paths are there?">>There are 12 "triggers" in all that lead to different text appearing in the final page inside the bar. A few of the story paths diverge and/or converge, but hitting upon the 12 is a good rule of thumb.\u000a\u000a[[Aaaaand what might those be?|hints1]]<<endreplace>> \u000a\u000a<<replace "Is there a 'final' ending?">>Yes; a new link will open once all twelve story paths have been visited. You can call it a coda, too. Whatever works.<<endreplace>> \u000a\u000aThat's all I have so far; if you have specific questions about the story, feel free to contact me at adeniro AT gmail DOT com.\u000a\u000a[[go back|end]]

VIt might be pretty self-evident at this point, but once you have completed a story path, the link to that path gets crossed out. So you will never need to do any backtracking (unless you want to). A couple of the story paths //do// follow the same route, at least part of the way (or with different characters). But it's usually the case that the scene includes two different P.O.V. characters.\u000a\u000a<<replace "I've followed eleven of the paths, but I can't seem to find the 12th.">>In all likelihood, this is going to come about from the "red path". The secret link. \u000a\u000aThe one exception to the 'strike-through' rule above is the "outsourcing"/Wyndham path. There is a link in that thread that appears very very briefly.\u000a\u000a[[Still stuck?|hints2]]<<endreplace>>\u000a\u000a[[go back to the bar|end]]\u000a\u000a[[go back to first hints page|hints]]

VIt appears on the page with the title "mathfrag", right after the text saying: "The warrior jumps into the forest feet first while being lectured."\u000a\u000aThe link appears after about 4 seconds and disappears after less than one second. \u000a\u000a[[go back to the bar|end]]\u000a\u000a[[go back to first hints page|hints]]
