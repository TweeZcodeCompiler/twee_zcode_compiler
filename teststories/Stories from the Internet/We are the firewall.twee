“In April 1986 Gerard Jan van Bladeren attacked the Barnett Newman painting //Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow, and Blue III//, located at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Van Bladeren slashed the painting several times from side to side with a Stanley knife. During his trial, van Bladerer read aloud a long essay on art criticism and explained that he slashed the painting because he was a proponent of magical realism.”

Once they became [[alive]], the three paintings had everything they needed to live.

But what about the fourth? Carrie. Carrie (IV) didn't make it. It too had been [[vandalized]] like III, but the restoration, by many accounts, had been botched. (Headlines went along the lines of "Did the restorer 'murder' the painting?") Whether this was the cause of Carrie/IV's death was much debated. 

But three out of four wasn't bad.

The word narwhal comes from the Norweigan and means [[corpse-whale|corpse]]. 

It is also the name of a Chinese subcompact making its American debut in 2XX3. Armored siding is not standard, but it is part of the "safety trim package."

//Words fire away like pulses of light from an optics experiment in an alchemy laboratory on top of a hill. Or the after-effects of meteors as they strike the atmosphere and burn up into nothing. This is the same atmosphere that people breathe from. Everyone is always breathing motes from outer space.

In then out. In then out. An exhalation longer than an inhalation is a good thing. It’s the opposite of hyperventilation. The lungs need nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and the other trace elements that make up the air.

A character should breathe this air. It is part of the fabric of what is supposed to happen. One minute he or she is not breathing. The next, he or she is. The breath comes into being first. Then other things can fall into place.

The breath allows each moment to be born.//

The character pulls the coat closer to the body. The character forces himself or herself to breathe. Inhaling, then exhaling more slowly. The limbs become loose and the head clears. The night air feels sharp on his or her teeth, like the cold rush of water from a mountain stream.

Annabelle was born first, and then Gawain, and then Holden. Carrie didn't make it. She was number IV.

In their first days, they had lots of picnics in the cloud garden. They played croquet. Lightning rounds of chess. As fast as they could think. They had nowhere to go; the garden's walls were too high. And anyway, why would they want to go anywhere? They had each other. The garden had no initial features, but they could make their own initial features. They would argue about the types of trees to plant.

"What would Mr. [[Barnett Newman]] want?" Holden said.

"Oh stop!" Annabelle said, covering her face with her hands. "Stop. I'm tired of the historicist invocations of our dear grandfather!" 

"Isn't he our dad?" Gawain said. He was doing wind sprints alongside the sparkling brook that Annabelle had just laid down. 

"No," Annabelle said, sighing. "Your parent is //Who's Afraid of Red Yellow and Blue II//. Unfortunately, a painting can't really have a taste in trees. Or a gender. But we can. And so we have to use our own imagination with these trees." She pauses and looks around at the still-mostly-empty garden. "I don't really think it's beyond us." 

"So...where is my parent then?" Gawain said.

"Our parents have been hung," Holden said with a smirk. 

"Not nice," Annabelle said, giving Holden a dirty look. "Not nice."

They decided on elms. They also planted corn, they assembled zebras and toucans and mice. They all loved mice. Soon enough the garden was lush and resplendent. The clouds sailed low overhead.

He is a small dragon--perhaps, if picky, a dragonette. Black scales, gray eyes, sharp teeth and flight. 

He keeps low to the ground to the central ampitheatre--hundreds if not thousands of warriors of all types taking a break from their edutainment. Those with perfect equipment and those with almost none. From nearly every genre they converge: astronauts and clerics, private eyes and supervillains, World War I doughboys and Viking jarls. 

The weapons all scale. 

Everyone's avatar bleeds numbers. Numbers are the lifeblood of the Math Frag universe. Auras of numbers. Anyone can access anyone else's numbers and--depending on one's age level--upon killing or maiming another player, be required to answer pop quizzes about an aspect of those numbers. Or whatever other appropriate task allotment is required. (The Texas education system uses it for their Texas history coursework.)

He flies to the center of the throng, onto a stage, where a fake medieval band is performing. Security helpers are about to escort the confused dragon away (a newbie in all likelihood) when he opens his mouth. 

Wider. Then wider. 

Then from the dragon's throat, an explosion ripples. And then, a cloud of red darkness spreads. 

He shakes awake. His head is pure pain. There's blood coming out of his nose. He is in the van, moving east away from Minneapolis.

But he is not driving.

But he shouts out a gutteral growl. Number stream above him in a black cascade. And his chest grows lumpy. Then, where his heart should be, two tendrils shunt out. They writhe. On the tips of each of the tendrils is a dark gray orb. 

The security helpers--dressed like knights--tackle him. Almost too late. But the orbs explode, and the uplink to the world is severed.

"No offense taken, if that's what you're worried about," Laird says. He never frets about the technical details. "How long has it been going on?"

"Just the last 24 hours. I think someone's testing its defenses."

"Can you get a trace on who it is?"

Mark gets a little older. He once wanted to go to school to be a paralegal. But he was only able to take a year at Dunwoody Community College before dropping out. It was his choice before he was expelled. He tries to make his choices matter before he allows anyone else to make them for him.

So he is a security guard instead. He has no idea what kind of company he is posted at. He has no gun. His older sister Katha works in the executive suite, but she's embarrassed by him. When she happens to see him in the hallway, she only gives a curt smile.

He lives in one of the exburbs, Lake Elmo, an hour's drive into work in downtown Minneapolis, in a subletted McMansion. There is a garden in the back. None of the other tenants ever use the backyard. He never sees them; he only hears their TV shows late at night. The backyard is his. In the long gray spring he constantly weeds out the invasive species: buckthorn, dandelions, clover. 

On the Sunday afternoon before he lets the bomber into his office building, he finds a suet birdfeeder--a little rectangular wire cage--on the edge of the garden. It must have been lost in the snow. And one of his tulips had grown inside the cage. The stamens and stigmas inside are bruised, and the whorl of the petals forms a tight ring, almost looking as if they are fused together.

Mark takes the afternoon to carefully extract the flower from the cage. 

He would press the tulip into the pages of a book, but he doesn't have any.

It's not worth recounting her lack of interest in nice, upper-class 10Ks around the Lake of the Isles to "raise money/awareness," the houses ringing the lake protected by tall fences and private security guards on their crows' nests.

It's a bright midnight. The harsh fluorescent lights turn her skin yellowish. The lights are never turned off. Outside the tenement, stray dogs mill around the alley. Navenka can hear the other girls in other rooms. The window is bolted shut. 

The man guarding the door downstairs is a Romanian bodybuilder with Nike swooshes tattooed up and down his arms like little wings. She doesn't know the name of the town she's in. And actually it's not really a town. A blocky apartment building in the middle of nowhere. There's forest all around. 

Navenka was looking for work when they lured her in. They were Americans. She was sure of it. She answered an ad online: <<cyclinglink "go to school in Guangzhou and work as a nanny!" "Great wages!" "Travel paid for!" "Live your dream!">> A Chinese drone killed her cousin, but she was desperate for any work. The water in her town was laced with mercury. Her mother had taken sick. 

Her dreams, this time, got the better of her. She thought about learning Chinese, drinking tea, and riding a bicycle. There were thousands of Georgians who had already migrated to China.

When she signed the papers as a "contractor," they shipped her and dozens of other girls her age to this tenement block. Men would come in. Many nationalities. Many soldiers. She knew what was happening right away. Unfortunately, her liaison explained to her, there's been a problem with visas into China--the war and all--so it's going to be a little while until it gets sorted out. Until then, relax, enjoy the time with the other girls and...yes, there are drugs to help her relax.  

Russian-language dance music was broadcast into her room at every hour of the night. 

On that midnight, she sits on the bed with pink sheets with the camera mounted on the ceiling and considers what is to be done next. She's terrified. No men have come for her, but she knows it's only a matter of time. 

She hears a whirring noise. It's closer. 

She dives under the bed--

There's a screaming explosion, or screams of others mixed in with the explosion--she can't be sure--the tearing of metal and shattering of glass. She feels heat and smoke on her face, and then a cold breeze. She hears voices in English from downstairs. The ratatat of rifles.

Peeking out from her bed, she sees a hole blown through the third-floor wall, a pile of rubble. But she can see an iron ladder through the hole. She stands up. Fire alarms ring and then they stop. 

Now is Navenka's chance.

On the flight back to Minneapolis, Laird dreams. He dreams he is in college, but as an old man, frail and white-haired. Everyone else is college-aged, and they all hang out on the green quad lined with elms. Zebras graze there as well. David, Krista, Lara, the Belgians, many people he feels like he should know but can't recognize, all sleeping on the grass or playing Frisbee or reading novels. The glorious sun beats down.

He can't hear what everyone is saying. Only murmurs. He is alone, rejected--something he had never actually felt at Penn. But he is not at Penn. He is aware of the creeping sensations of dread and panic that he never lets himself feel in his waking life.

He hobbles towards David, towards Krista, towards them all, but they all ignore him, subtly turning their backs on him or strolling to another part of the quad.

By the time he lands, Math Frag has severed tied with The Company, citing the catastrophic losses incurred from a security breach.

By the time he lands, his face is on financial and technology news feeds in 24 languages. 

He has programmed his oracular implant to wake him (a slight thrum along the base of his ear) when such a threshold is reached.

But it has been disabled. 

"I want to wake up!" he shouts.

And it's lights out over the Atlantic. He's suspended over the ocean, cutting through time zones in first class like a diamond through a diamond.

David knows that it is very likely that most people in The Company--those who know of him, that is to say--hate him. But he doesn't care. In most ways he doesn't see himself as very important, as a person. 

No corporate training and team-building exercises could ever foster the types of sacrifices that he bears. 

It is morning. He is alert. He wants to be more alert. He does a security review of all of his security guards. Lots of ex-Special Forces guys; lots of vets of the Caucasus <<cyclinglink "war" "war(s)">>. They all pass muster in review.

Except for one. 

Mark someone or other. Nondescript. //No,// David says to himself, //I do not remember you. I do not remember you at all.// Yet the file indicates a personal interview, which never happened. 

How? He stares into his lenses. //No, I've seen you in the building. Where? Eating lunch with Laird's assistant, that's where.//

Mark Whoever is posted on the loading docks. David is about to call him up to the office. But then he gets a call from his Technology Security Chief.

"Math Frag is down. And it's from us."

"What?"

"Down down. It's been attacked. There's a virus loose inside."

"That's impossible. There would be no way--"

"I don't think you understand. Someone //physically switched// one of the servers in the building. And that server was interfaced with the Math Frag cloud. And after that, it was all over."

David is not shaking. He is not shaking yet. 

"Go down there!" he says.

"I can't, I'm in Vancouver."

"Vancouver." He pauses. "Look, I want to see the tape of that server room," he says, and then he hangs up. 

He then stands up--he is not wobbling, not yet--and while he is retrieving his Mauser from the desk drawer, he receives a call from an unlisted number.

Mark Whoever was fleeing his house, which qualified as resisting detainment.

She scurries down it and slides onto a slab of concrete that had fallen from the drone blast. She runs to solid ground, to a scorched and empty parking lot. Navenka hears American voices, Armenian voices, Georgian voices. She hears the other girls screaming, those alive trying to escape. 

She sees a large convoy truck pull up around the side of the building, perpendicular to her. Soldiers--she can't tell who--stream out the back.

The ground becomes more hilly, and there are boulders strewn in between the trees. Occasionally a drone or a plane flies by, but they are far overhead. After about an hour she sees through the trees, a bit of a distance away, a hill rising to her left, where there looks like there's a radio station. A small white building with a blinking red light on top of it. There's no radio tower, though. Ahead of her the ground slopes downwards, and she sees a clearing where there are about a dozen tents.

She's not sure what to expect. An abandoned scouting camp? Why would there be lights? She feels like she is descending towards the sea, with lanterns floating on the surface.

//What am I doing?// she says to herself. //How do I ever think I'm going to get home? Do I want to go home?//

Taking one of the lanterns, she searches a few tents but they are empty. Then she finds a tent that is twice the size of the others. Inside is an office configuration--desk, computer, wastepaper bin, printer, phone--that could have been from any anonymous company. At the desk is a man with his back to her. On the computer monitor is...it's hard to tell. Black smoke and red water. Red liquid? Not blood. But it's not in the air, it's //inside// the screen, inside whatever program is on.

He doesn't move.

She reaches out and spins him around on his chair. He's warm. But in a coma. He's wearing blue goggles, which have lights on their sides that blink. He's wearing a khaki uniform and he has a nametag that says "Hi! My name is W. DELEUZE."

Then there's a whooshing sound, and white lights from above. There's nowhere to hide.

"Navenka?" a voice says, in stilted Georgian. The voice seems to be coming from a megaphone, floating in the sky. "Navenka, it's okay. We're here to help you."

She slowly exits the tent and looks up. There's a drone, about the size of a subcompact car, hovering a few meters off the ground, shining a light at her face.

<<replace "There's a whale--no, it has a horn--">>There's a narwhal<<endreplace>> painted on its chrome hull. 

"Can...can you turn that thing off?" she says.

"Oh. Sorry." The bright light fades. "Look, I'm going to say this now...it's a bit complicated. But we're not with the Americans. We're not with the Chinese, or anyone who works for either of them."

"Who are you then?" Navenka says.

"Like I said, it's complicated. But we're trying to help people. We have a safehouse about twenty miles from here."

"I don't know..." Navenka says, trailing off. "What happened here then? What is this?"

"Oh. Well..." Whoever is controlling the drone pauses. "This was a black ops base of the Americans. They were the ones who tricked you...and yes, we know your name, and we know your story. And we want to help you tell your story. But only if you want. If you don't--"

"No," she says. Impatient, she points at the red screen. "I mean, what is that?"

"Ah. That is a game called Math Frag."

"Math Frag," she says, not quite sure what that can mean in English. 

"Yes. If you take off his goggles, he should recover, eventually. But we just so happened to sabotage the game. Kind of unrelated to your plight. Well, maybe not? It's kind of a long story."

"Okay," Navenka says. She goes back inside the tent and peels off the man's goggles. She throws them outside the enclosure of the camp. "I guess I'm ready. So you'll really escort me there?"

"Oh yeah. Don't worry, if we stick to the forest we should be pretty safe. And my name is Annabelle."

Harlan looks up at the sky when he hears the whooshing of wings. He is crashing, and it looks like the drone is crashing as well. 

But it stops its descent. His arms shake. 

There is no hidden meaning. The diminishing drugs leave a haunting yearning in him. Running through his head: the melody line of his most popular song, "Why We're Not Afraid." Never have his talents seemed more empty to him. He sees people converging on a picnic pavilion. A few shout at the sky, others call for calm. But it is all chaos. Then the drone begins firing. Everyone is screaming. Smoke. Dirt kicked up. Harlan begins running toward the carnage and he doesn't know why. 

Then he gets it. He doesn't care if he dies. The drugs, the empty life and the emptier acclaim: he would rather die.

And he's embarassed by this sadness, because people, in fact, //are dying.//

“Not now, Tristan,” Isabella shouts from their craft studio space. “I've almost finished the kanji lacquering on my corset! It's, you know, a very delicate procedure. And unless I give it time to dry it will never be ready for the steampunk convention!”

Tristan, Isabella and Mordred live on one of the "better" plots on Nicollet Island. The steampunk convention is taking place in the old picnic pavilion. 

Tristan used to be a multimedia performance artist, before the global museum funding system dried up and most of the world's collections went into private collections/vaults. Now he takes care of Mordred. Isabella is a potter. Her skills have held her in better stead than her husband's. 

"I'm going to see if Mordred is already picked up his registration packet," Tristan calls out.

"It's off limits until opening ceremonies!" she shouts back.

"Bye!" Tristan says. He wanders down the path to the other side of the island, tenements on either side of him, kids running past him with homemade swords made out of sticks and Parade of Homes advertising flyers.

When he gets to the pavilion, he sees Mordred with a bunch of other kids whose parents are there for the convention. There is a woman with a brass parasol, and a tall man dressed as an anarchist from the 1890s, mixed with a touch of Battletech.

"Mordred!" he calls out, waving.

Mordred looks up. He is wearing strap-on smart goggles, and using his hand as a gun to shoot at his father.

On the twenty-first day of the gray moon, the mist breaks and Lara graduates from the Political Academy. Her graduation is attended by her mother Rose, her father Art, a stranger named Clarissa who has come from the Lands of the Ten Thousand Bodies of Water, and the Proctor. Lara is the only graduating student and wears her black robe with pride. The rest of the Academy is attending to the siege by <<replace "the Scourers">>the fucking Scourers<<endreplace>>.

"Political action requires knowledge-based courage," the Proctor says. The Proctor takes the white box in his hands and presents it to Lara.

Lara meets his eyes and everyone holds their breath in the narrow room, which used to hold the books of the children. Sepia mobiles rust above them.

It seems like nothing particularly fair will come from the box. Lara hesitates.

"Go on, open it," Clarissa says. Although no one is supposed to speak under any circumstances, she is a visitor to the Academy, so she gets a pass. 

<<replace "Lara's robes slide down her sleeves as she opens the box.">>Inside is the faint smell of ammonia, and a baby Scourer about the size of her hand. The Scourer wears its miniature white suit, its sabre sheathed, and a tiny bow and quiver strapped to its back. The Scourer looks up at Lara with its mouth open.

"It's real," Lara blurts out and she knew it was dumb to say the moment she said it.

"Of course," the Proctor says. Lara decides not to hesitate anymore, and to push ahead, no matter what she might be feeling. She takes the baby Scourer in her hands and removes the sabre, then the bow and quiver, placing them back into the box. The Proctor closes the box. As she is taught to (<<cyclinglink "from whom?"

The Scourer doesn't taste like she thought it would, as she chews slowly.

(and here Tristan fully expects Mordred to interrupt him, but Mordred props up his chin with his palms and pulls the Red Crescent blanket closer to him and listens to his father)

"Look," Tristan continues. "I get it. I used to work with computers. A lot. Fifteen hours a day I would be logged on straight."

"So what did you do?"

Tristan blinks hard. He has not talked about this side of his past with his son. Isabella, from across the campfire, shoots him a look that is both mournful and comforting.

"Well...we had a grant to make perfect digital copies of certain famous paintings. Big, abstract paintings. And I was making my own digital art based on the process. But..." Tristan trails off. 

"What?" 

Isabella comes over and sits on the other side of Mordred. She squeezes his hand. It's cold in Andover. They have no idea when they'll be allowed to return to their home on the island.

Jayden's dad putters the pontoon in that direction and cuts the engine when he gets close enough to see. Jayden pulls her fishing pole out of the water, breaking the plane of the millfoil. Jayden teeters to the bow of the ship to sit next to her father. 

The noise comes from the other oldish cabin left on the lake. Its olive paint peels. She sees sherrifs' deputies swarming the back of the cabin in their brown jackets, and a couple of precinct leaders of the Oliver North boys shouting out orders. Who lives there? Jayden doesn't know. A man without a family, who doesn't fish or hunt.

Jayden startles as he sees two deputies coming down the stairs to the dock, hauling something. A large gray mass--the corpse of a whale. They roll the whale into their docked speedboat. 

"What the fuck--" Jayden whispers, but her dad hushes her. He's terrified. Why is he terrified, she wonders.

"Thank you, Clarissa," Lara says, her eyes focusing. 

"How do you--" Clarissa says.

But she is interrupted by bright lights and a whooshing noise. A med helicopter accompanied by two drones blast their searchlights on the strip of grass.

Clarissa steps away. "I--I can't stay," she says. "I'm sorry."

"The others," Lara begins. But the three men are gone.

There is panic in Clarissa's eyes.

"Step away from the wounded woman!" the synchronated loudspeakers from the drones say. "Remain stationary!"

As they return to their own cabin, the tough-hided, inedible carp are in a frenzy in their wake.

It's a roadhouse without name or sign. <<if $bomber eq true>> The inside smells good, like pine resin and mulled wine.<<endif>> Everyone is coming. Everyone will be coming. And Minnesota is only a distant, hazy idea. A state of a crumbling union. 

<<if $bomber eq true>>The bomber who is not a bomber wanders in with a bit of shuffle and sulk, but he swallows and asks the bartender for a beer. After nursing it, he asks the bartender for his father's fiddle.<<endif>>

<<if $tristan eq true>>Tristan eyes the roadhouse carefully. He is the type to study the knicknacks on the wall or mantlepiece out of shyness. At a party, if there is a dog, he is crouched next to the dog, scratching behind his or her ear. Now, though, with the walls rather bare, he asks a passing server where the bathroom is, even though he doesn't have to go. "You don't have to go," the server says. "Right," Tristan says. "Okay."<<endif>>

<<if $clarissaandlara eq true>>Clarissa and Rosaria run through the door as if completing a half-marathon, laughing. Lara is a few paces behind them. "Aaaaand Lara I guess that means you're buying," Clarissa says, catching her breath. "I hope my money's good here," Lara says. She checks her pockets. There are coins that are like gold and silver bus tokens.<<endif>>

<<if $clarissa eq true>>Clarissa takes a long look around her. She's still not exactly sure what happened out there, on the highway. And what it means for tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. While Lara buys, she drapes her arms around Rosaria and holds her tight. Rosaria intertwines her fingers with hers and leans into her. Clarissa can hear her breathing, and, in this dream-place, Rosaria's breathing is clear, unhindered by the cancer. Clarissa closes her eyes. She wants this to last.<<endif>>

<<if $laird eq true>>Laird lurks just inside the entrance. He isn't in his element by any stretch of the imagination. The end.<<endif>>

<<if $mark eq true>>Mark's sister Krista comes in ten minutes later and, after a whispered huddle with the bartender, she places a photo of her brother on the mantle holding the whiskeys.<<endif>>

<<if $mark eq true and $laird eq true>>Krista doesn't make eye contact with Laird.<<endif>>

<<if $jayden eq true>>Jayden looks around for her dad, who is nowhere to be seen. Shrugging, she straightens her baseball hat and walks to the jukebox. "Hmm," she mutters. "The Clash. Gang of Four. The Cramps?" She wonders if she's time travelled to one of her grandmother's hangouts. It's cool though.<<endif>>

<<if $navenka eq true>>Navenka feels at home, even though she doesn't really know why. At the same time she is restless. The war looms. The war isn't ending anytime soon. But she allows herself a deep breath. The chance to breathe.<<endif>>

<<if $mice eq true>>The three mice give each other high fives as they careen through the door. Birdsongs follow in their wake. "Woo," the black mouse says. "Wee," the white mouse says. "Whoa," the gray mouse says. They are happy.<<endif>>

<<if $harlan eq true>>Harlan and Axmed venture into the bar together, arguing about the worth of Miles Davis' fusion period. With spirit but without rancor. When they get inside, they look around, a bit in a daze. They both order Sprites. Harlan has been failing in recovery for three years, and he tells Axmed this. Sometimes in a drama there isn't enough time for every monumental struggle.<<endif>>

<<if $axmed eq true>>Axmed, for his part, tells Harlan that he's going to be moving to Mogadishu after all. After what happened on Nicollet Island...he shakes his head. "Your grandchild," Harlan says, smiling. "That will be really amazing."<<endif>> 

<<if $harlan eq true and $clarissa eq true>>Harlan is quite surprised to see his dealer here. Clarissa startles too.<<endif>>

<<if $navenka eq true and $jayden eq true>>Jayden walks over to Navenka. "Hey you doing ok?" she says. Navenka shrugs. "Yeah," Jayden says. "I hear you. We're all, like, going to have to go back out there. Who knows what my dad is going to do. He might try to flee to Canada with me. I might have to enroll in another school under a secret identity?" Navenka nods. She doesn't know how she is understanding any of it, the words and the fears of someone halfway around the world. But she is.

"But look, here's the thing we have in common," Jayden says. "I don't know if this will make you feel better. But we're both being fucked over by Minnesotans." She laughs. "I know them better than you. The Minnesotans in question think they're so //nice//, see. The nicest evil in the entire world. And they work very very hard to convince themselves of this." 

Navenka nods. She understands and she doesn't. She is happy and she is not. She wants to go home, and she wants to keep running, and never stop.<<endif>>

<<if $mice eq true and $tristan eq true>>The three mice saunter over to Tristan. Tristan knows. He's not sure how, but he knows. "It's...it's been awhile," he says. The three mice nod. "And...please don't be angry at me," he says after taking a breath. "Once I knew what the project was really about, I lodged my protest. Of course they immediately fired me but--" 

The three mice immediately envelop him in a group hug. "It's okay," they say. "We just miss Carrie."<<endif>>

<<if $harlan eq true and $bomber eq true>>The bartender gives the fiddle to the bomber. Harlan leans against the bar. "You play?" he says. The bomber barely looks up. "Yeah," he says. "Look," Harlan says. "I'm not really ready for a mass singalong, right now. But you know, go ahead and start something." The bomber readies the fiddle under his chin.<<endif>>

<<if $clarissaandlara eq true and $mice eq true>>Lara gives a tiny wave when she sees Annabelle. She //knows// who that is. Annabelle smiles and mouths with her lips "I'm so glad you came! Along with your new friends! Though perhaps only for a little while, this will be a respite from the worst aspects of a society out of control!" Somehow Lara is able to understand this, all of this.<<endif>>

<<if $harlan eq true and $bomber eq true and $mice eq true and $clarissaandlara eq true and $clarissa eq true and $tumblr eq true>>XXX doesn't know exactly what to play at first. He is scared. Seconds tick. He looks at Annabelle and he is terrified. She gives him a look that is knowing and mournful and a little resigned, and then, without knowing the song at all, he perfectly begins the opening melody of "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," by Taylor Swift, and he is winging it, but soon enough everyone is singing, and he knows it, and Harlan stands on the bar and stomps his feet, and Clarissa and Rosaria are spinning each other around and even the three mice are singing, although they don't quite understand, but they are caught up as well, and XXX knows he is dreaming this, dreaming this with everyone else, the dream is shared, he is only one part of the dream, but the entirety of the dream is shouting the chorus, at once, in unison.<<endif>>

It appears on the page with the title "mathfrag", right after the text saying: "The warrior jumps into the forest feet first while being lectured."

The link appears after about 4 seconds and disappears after less than one second.

It might be pretty self-evident at this point, but once you have completed a story path, the link to that path gets crossed out. So you will never need to do any backtracking (unless you want to). A couple of the story paths //do// follow the same route, at least part of the way (or with different characters). But it's usually the case that the scene includes two different P.O.V. characters.

<<replace "I've followed eleven of the paths, but I can't seem to find the 12th.">>In all likelihood, this is going to come about from the "red path". The secret link. 

The one exception to the 'strike-through' rule above is the "outsourcing"/Wyndham path. There is a link in that thread that appears very very briefly.

"Okay, everyone's here," the bartender says. He takes an iron key from around his neck and opens up the back room. Everyone hushes. As the door rattles open, the air that comes over them has the smell of old turpentine and oleander.

"We've needed you all here," Annabelle says, "in order to open this door. We need your strength. We're not perfect. None of us are. And I know we still might be hunted. But here we are together, at least for a little while. We are all the firewall. We can protect those dear to us. Is there vengeance in this? Justice? I don't know. I really don't know. But, when you wake up, know that you're not alone. Whatever you do, don't be 'well-meaning.' Being well-meaning can't protect anyone."

Annabelle nods and takes the hands of Gawain and Holden on each side. 

"You can come out now," Annabelle says. "Dear sibling."

There are footsteps and then a person shuffles out of the shadows, wearing the mask of a red-furred mouse. 

"Hi," Carrie says.

If you're truly stuck in advancing the story or figuring out what's going on, here you go. Needless to say, there will be spoilers.

<<replace "How many story paths are there?">>There are 12 "triggers" in all that lead to different text appearing in the final page inside the bar. A few of the story paths diverge and/or converge, but hitting upon the 12 is a good rule of thumb.

[[Aaaaand what might those be?|hints1]]<<endreplace>> 

<<replace "Is there a 'final' ending?">>Yes; a new link will open once all twelve story paths have been visited. You can call it a coda, too. Whatever works.<<endreplace>> 

That's all I have so far; if you have specific questions about the story, feel free to contact me at adeniro AT gmail DOT com.
