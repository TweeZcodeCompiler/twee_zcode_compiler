V<<set $statusText="About Hallowmoor">><<showstatus>>\u000aHallowmoor is hypertext-based interactive fiction. Your actions control the story. To reach the end, you'll need to be clever and thorough. Read, play, and enjoy the adventure!\u000a\u000aPlaying is simple. Each passage has one or more highlighted keywords. Click a keyword to follow it forward; for instance, into a different room, or to inspect some object, or to talk to a character.\u000a\u000aA special keyword appears in the status bar at the top, during normal play. This "Inventory" option allows you to inspect items you are carrying. In certain situations, you may be able to use these items for specific purposes, either to advance the story or solve a puzzle. As you progress, you may acquire new items that will appear in your inventory.\u000a\u000aWhen you reach an ending, play again by using the "Restart" link from the sidebar on the left. The game also allows you to reverse losing endings immediately, without starting over.\u000a\u000a''Tip!'' If your browser is maximized on a large monitor and you don't like reading across long lines of text, try making it a smaller window for a more book-like layout.\u000a\u000a''Important!'' Do not use your browser's BACK button while playing this game. It will //not// undo prior choices, but rather, it will take you back to the page you visited last. You can, however, save and load your progress between sessions using the [[system|SystemMenu]] menu.\u000a\u000aCredits and contact information can be found on the [[credits|Credits]] page.\u000a\u000a<<display "SystemLink">>

V<<set $tempTitle="Swamp">><<set $roomName="Hallowmoor Swamp">><<display "SetRoom">>\u000aNo part of this has been easy.\u000a\u000aFirst, you had to find just the right lonely old witch, rotting away in her candy cottage. Then you had to haunt her for what seemed an eternity just to get a sliver of information. That's how you learned that the potion could only be found in the catacombs of Castle Hallowmoor.\u000a\u000aThis posed another challenge. [[Specter Shift|LookAtSpecterShift]] would only be possible under certain celestial alignments, so it required a trip to a senile astronomer atop the tallest mountain in the land to determine exactly when this event would take place. (Being non-corporeal actually helped there.) But the event was soon, leaving very little time to find a skeleton perfectly suited to the task.\u000a\u000aThe perfect skeleton, as it happened, was essentially front-line fodder in an all-out attack planned against Castle Hallowmoor during this same celestial alignment. That was good in a way, since it would be easier to approach the castle amidst the siege. It was also supremely bad, considering that the Sisterhood of Witches would be fiercely defending their castle.\u000a\u000aNow, you are trekking through the fog and bog of the Hallowmoor swamp. The western end of the bridge to Castle Hallowmoor is only a short ways ahead. Your unwitting skeletal host is one among the hundreds of soldiers likely to be blasted bone-from-bone in the assault, but you push the thought away. You've come too far.\u000a\u000aThe <<print "[[bridge|GoEast]]">> is just ahead.<<display "UpdateStatus">>

Their wicked deeds have dwindled over the past two centuries. Sure, there may be occasional reports of the kid-tricking kind or other strange happenings //blamed// on a witch, but most of them stay [[close|Bridge]] to [[Castle Hallowmoor|BridgeCastle]]. Some say the witches are by and large reformed. Others insist they are simply biding their time while planning something profoundly evil. It doesn't matter to you, as long as the [[potion|BridgeEnd]] you need can be found in their castle catacombs.
