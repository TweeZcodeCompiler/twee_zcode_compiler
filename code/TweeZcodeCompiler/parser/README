CMake should recreate all generated files automatically.

To (re)generate the lexer and parser manually, use a shell, cd into this directory and
run the following commands:

flex -o GeneratedTweeLexer.cpp twee.ll
bison -d -o GeneratedTweeParser.cpp twee.yy

Minimum requirements:
flex 2.5.35
bison 3.0.2


*** NOTE FOR OS X ***
The default bison binaries on OS X are very old. CMake is too dumb to find the required
bison when installed via homebrew/macports. The only workaround for now is to move the
bison binary out of /usr/bin and ln to a appropriate version. This is incredibly dirty.
